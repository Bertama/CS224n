You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, probably I'm the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and never one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell to you.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went to cast it every week in the kids' bathroom, until a teacher saved me life.
She saved my life in the room in the school room.
He did it on secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never came to us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, I would like you to tell you please."
Well, next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found it a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a <unk> box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the back of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of your life.
It needs real and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them up around the water -- almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> year after a year.
The <unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break the ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of the people who refuse to lead and hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford it more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts as a <unk> I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As it melts a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was trying to be the portraits.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you is from a iceberg I photographed in <unk>
It's <unk> to actually get to witness a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing up there.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> from water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one of a <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of the conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of all, you're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome is tied into the X chromosome of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome joins the <unk> X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go to talk about them later.
In my ground activity to deliver two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way that people are looking at the anatomy of human bodies, and <unk> and <unk> how have the body fluid -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that works in my work is the activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people who are much lower than average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male schemes and conventional feminine <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of the ways of having a sex that you didn't belong in the common form or a females.
For example, there's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene in the chromosome is said to the <unk> that we all have in the life that we have in the life of <unk> <unk>
And then in life, the testicles make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So there's high testosterone levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops on a course, typically female.
When you <unk> the baby is a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl, it's raised as a little girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, it as puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast time, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think this is a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most of the women as I -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his structure, <unk> I believe being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I received a call from a 19 year-old boy who was born and raised as a <unk> had girlfriend, and a life as a kid and he had just discovered that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was some 20th <unk> and on the uterus <unk> <unk> were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors found that, in fact, was a woman on the inside.
Well, another example of a <unk> case.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue, wrapped in <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that kids with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they <unk> to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have a <unk> identity -- it would be black, they mean having African anatomy in historical terms.
A very simplistic. idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very simple ideas in our culture of <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is having children that are born like two people within a body.
The most high case is the last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test to do to figure out whether <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there are not such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who designed that line.
So what we have is a situation in which the more we have to go further through science, more we have to admit that these categories were very stable categories -- stable categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology on the <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we get into science we get more and more of a very awkward zone where we have to recognize that the categories are probably probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them put up a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved not to the <unk>
And if I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of really determining people's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple sphere of the past.
And perhaps think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
I assume that these categories are much more fragile than we thought to <unk>
It will come from the concept of a concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent snake <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find every bit of looking at that piece of looking at that music, <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
The Parents -- they were <unk> the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they had to do, was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everyone remember, what our wives would do, was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth <unk>
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the power of the political power was coming from the <unk> of the father to the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created equal.
<unk> the game of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was human anatomy and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time when we get the science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the Parents -- that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were getting rid of the <unk> explanations -- and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> <unk> that was passed away from a <unk> <unk> idea.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of human rights.
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color in color that are going to be <unk> about the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow Movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we hold certain <unk>
But look, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't mean that the age of five years would have to allow them to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try and figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
So imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June June 1980.
Just Henry, in the contrary, was born on the March March of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary <unk> the rights three months before to Henry -- the right -- the right to the sexual consent, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that because they have a different age, but because she was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the dreams that Mary doesn't have to worry.
<unk> on the hand, don't have the same rights as I was going to like the <unk> in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories, which in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went down so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to be <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas has been determined to get married with a man not to have a chromosome and to marry a woman there is to have a chromosome <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests on the <unk>
But this is also very strange, given the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I have a <unk> "I have a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do people judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we had to put it on this for rights to the rights of people, because I have to admit that I know that I know that I know that I know that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that perhaps some of the <unk> that I know can make a lot more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships that people who know about 40 that I know.
So how do we put the theme of the <unk> content.
It's very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current current thing to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to be <unk> unless he is willing to stand for the change of sex, in which case it is being allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made light identical <unk> to then pick it out and get the pick of their fame.
But when the phone asked him the <unk> of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, responded to that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum instead of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who they are <unk> to change by the good state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish the end of it, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we had given more involvement to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a <unk> and I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in looking for sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in Feminism <unk> I was struck as <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most dumb question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes of gender stereotypes -- so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've ever thought about your question, most of me have seemed like there is something <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brains and the male that makes us more attached to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers were very adept at finding the way to protect the people in the state, it's possible that, to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we get the democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just put it out by buildings in apartments.
So imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartment they were already owners, and that the other half is still keeping it to do this.
You could try to increase the ability to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building ecosystems.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, build a new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place will build the construction instead of putting them down.
So I suggested that the governments that are <unk> new parts of waste enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75 people -- they knew that their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, it was passed by a Chinese crisis.
And in the next few elections, we have <unk> <unk> <unk> imposed on a platform in which we would create reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to <unk> his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of testing with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the significance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and bother all the current residents of apartments.
It will make a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much about technologies like <unk> and usually the rules that get us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we sat down in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, so much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place in <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way our country move forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that you measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The conference leader came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city where you might go into <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders, they need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that they would help them be able to establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust the <unk> so that they could actually trust the <unk>
We went and saw a place.
This photo is there.
I could only cover a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a Chinese disposal that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this criminal crisis, the voting in Congress for this Chinese <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the people are all <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed another time in a voting basis, to bring it to one.
Immediately after the voting level, from 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> is to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center in the city that is building in Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after that it was four years old, getting the <unk>
The other interest in building in cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and it would be able to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that want to be in the <unk> especially in a place of <unk> and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family in order to get a work, sometimes they have unwed mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even the kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you for you to <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is in the inside, I'm going to make a <unk> and that's that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, and most recently, photograph and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog <unk> colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> <unk> and <unk> stores.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I am going to meet people who are <unk> by the general way that my money is going to a good <unk> My thing is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
Like, <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, so I feel that I've won.
So going back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I mean.
I brought up seven pairs of within, and nothing else.
It was inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after you get here to <unk>
And since I don't know about the woman as the woman who walks for TED in within,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the <unk> for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see great for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me off, and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you can also tell you.
<unk> <unk> from the child to take inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like to call it and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you believe that you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside there -- there are no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything that we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is all not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy, <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> by one of these extreme ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people -- that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So some intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing on a parking bar.
It was a little kid and didn't do it very well, it was always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar <unk> he taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with parking bars, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote all of these observations, and called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need them to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it's because I don't often play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, you never saw one <unk>
But it didn't fit it right to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow the principles of the mechanics <unk>
I don't find the reason why I didn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see it's been on a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to broaden it a little bit in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach, the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a little bit of metal, with a trampoline form, and that stands up on a platform.
And so I made this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip of silicon again, and I started to work all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming hole that finds underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap -- but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable is being in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when another people go up and do those things, because I don't want them to get them out, or actually it <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues in the journey of inanimate objects are not just people who are <unk> and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat in the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal will behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights -- then they <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air -- and then they put it into a temperature of less than a degree on the absolute absolute zero.
Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the little metal piece is free of acting as you want.
So we measure their motions.
We found that moving in very weird ways.
Instead of staying pretty still, it was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breathing in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft thrust, we could make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal that are still -- and at the same time those same time those same atoms are moving up to the top.
It's just <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> the <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on the scale between one atom -- and that little metal piece is more or less the same as the difference that the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one only atom may be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece may be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that I speech.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you use your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about what quantum mechanics says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
So those connections, your connections to all the things around you, they literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it was 18 months ago, I was doing another kind of Google <unk> until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, it was <unk> by 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't care about it, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show that a demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are there.
There's the <unk> gallery -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> Van <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorites, at the <unk> the art museum in New York art.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You're moving around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and we just jump inside.
They're inside, that you want to go to the end of the hallway, you want to go to the end of the hallway, you want to go to the end of the hallway, you want to go to the end of the hallway, you want to go to the end of the hallway, you want to go to the end of the hallway, you want to go to the end
They keep forward. That <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's the whole information of <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems like <unk>
And I walked in, and I found that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get more deep deep and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is coming, a second.
So now we're very quickly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night.
The example I showed it was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everybody, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create their own museum -- create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just put a zooming around.
This is about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at looking at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even they don't get from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that they do today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about it is a <unk> <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian, all kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting about careers of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
A few time ago, if you wanted to win a career for Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering, it is <unk> real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that real control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting back to the open <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of <unk> consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms would become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
It was almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end of the end, he threw it up to the <unk> and he threw it up to the Moses -- you know, you can see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> non <unk> and so what don't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember -- they played Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity happening in the net.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line is on the top.
At the early evening there are people out here and there doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
People do a quick call and goes into the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk>
There you see the big step.
The next day everyone went to the center of the team and the winner and the prime minister in the time.
And then everybody else <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people go to <unk> is a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how do they get <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some little tags to track the trash in their change in the system.
We started with a volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, like you can see, things that all modes of <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a label on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there are a lot of need to do it.
But the other thing we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is not still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we just put on one day still on there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the very beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology do technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you get <unk> vacuum tubes, <unk> you open up and <unk>
It creates like a water curtain, with the pixels of water.
If they fall down the pixels and the pixels can be written on them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in the curtain -- the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building on the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no gates and no windows, but when you come up with it is open so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it's down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all of the architecture is just it in this case.
Those days, there will be somebody in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is working.
You see the people who are looking inside.
And here I'm myself right now, trying not to be <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opened up to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water and you had to jump up and <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think about how people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that is moving in space.
This is the video.
So imagine a helicopter, like what we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
A flexible screen like this with a regular configuration in two dimensions.
Or do you normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes the light is not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different kind of thing.
So imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them <unk>
We can have each pixel with an entrance that comes from people, and so on, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of mine today, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk>
On the left you see the <unk> the capture of different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D <unk> and real time capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can go around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm as a <unk> but a cloud.
So imagine that we could make all of us take a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible across the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go from the digital world of the <unk> power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean that it would mean that it would be built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to deal with the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do you go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And these particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel of the pixel in the ground.
You can move around, having different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the Beijing Olympics of the Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a kind of connection to the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new summit of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better form, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure themselves.
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most of the <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do we <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably had to have the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
Ah, most of them, that makes me feel very well like a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in addition to the <unk> Church -- he wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk> <unk>
But if they actually accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it on the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the other bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> asked them about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm up, hot. It's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort on your part.
It is really like a quick way for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some <unk> <unk>
But by the other thing, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something perhaps <unk>
And in this vast symphony that is <unk> in the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope that you've got it.
When I was just talking to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most existence in the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is simply split and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to the two daughters <unk>
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the <unk>
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens to the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death for <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more doubt.
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel party.
He opens the door.
And in front of him you find a magnificent blue dancer, a little <unk>
He looks at it and he says, "You know, look for a <unk> <unk>
She's <unk> says, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal of the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make it healthy.
I wanted to regain health in the disease.
I wanted we live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about passing the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of an evolutionary view, you and I are like <unk> designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think all of the <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily expense to longevity.
It doesn't necessarily harm the bigger or stronger or more intelligent and even the smartest ones.
Evolution favors the best <unk> creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and successful.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be able to be able to have fish there, fish fish <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> stage, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We have reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning is that through medicine, in the first place, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment in order to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for that evolution.
A second possibility is that we have a <unk> evolution of kind of natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be, that the gears of the evolution roll roll it slowly, but they're <unk>
And as much as a sort of <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- an intriguing and scary possibility.
I call this <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for the society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think of it also that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project, in 1990, and he was 13 years old.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot to make the human genome to actually make the human genome for <unk> and to be more and more of the reach of all.
They get those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they will induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trials in the course of the vaccine against <unk> <unk> cells in a power plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change their <unk> cells.
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the rare egg -- and give their children a better opportunity for a healthier life to remove the diabetes, eliminate the diabetes to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who does not want children to be <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of the science that can produce the changes for preventing disease is also going to allow us to have a better memory.
Why don't we have the <unk> of an Ken <unk> especially if you could get them to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in the conditions of going to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want we should be the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can get it back to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options in advance of a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For the good or for worse, and before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants <unk>
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
And the pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
Are we <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three words the three words I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes,
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought all the people that I wanted to come in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, later on, I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to hear me -- nothing in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is the <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about -- Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also led to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I <unk> in things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have no reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to have 14, 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, I'm not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love it; I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> like a kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
They gave me a miracle, not die that day.
And I was awarded another gift that was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please do not -- but you can imagine, and you can imagine, and you can imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is the thing that they are still waiting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does their relations and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so that obviously, graffiti is something that is kind of <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "All I want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you see Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important person and you have a very good insurance that you can't actually do it.
These devices aren't affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone to see the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they're doing with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how he was going to <unk>
I met with his brother and his father there at that particular moment -- "All right, this is the <unk> Tony goes to talk, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on their inside can't be <unk>
So I talked at a conference a couple months later.
And I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer draw on that and recorded space space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with the sex organs, then with bad words, then with the bad words, and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life on their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving the things on one side to the other we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that you could see it would make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy with the guy getting an email from it, and you say, "Don't do it. This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers out of the whole world of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved into the garage garage and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid and that when they <unk> they would have taken the frames of the walls and then they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we had to go back to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a pair of glasses of <unk> that we bought on the <unk> ride in <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things from <unk> <unk> and Radio Radio
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds one, and we put the code off, the software <unk> the software becomes free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says <unk>
There is no hospital that can say it <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating using only his eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this is the other person's room and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of spending a intense people from all night, Tony turned back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We gave him the bed for him to see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went back to the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to me and would get me out there so that he could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything goes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine told us as one of the <unk> best inventions -- and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all of these are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what's in this room was possible -- the scenario, the computer -- the computer -- the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Do it <unk> any thing in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with computer recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find it with something that we feel that I feel that we need to do. If it's not now <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years ago in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time as a dangerous thing.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> hard areas and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days and eating only this -- a lot of fun in the very beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in terrible appearance with the only goal to try to examine social questions in ways that make <unk> attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that look like <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'm going to come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard the ear, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter I volunteered for the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was doing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- that you have no idea what it is and according to content I could focus on the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good chance to get it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy your name rights.
If you asked me a year ago, I couldn't have been able to do it with certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said before, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done with it for something so difficult or so dangerous as I get into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I tried to try and do a film that I tried to try and the advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and <unk>
The film is going to call "The largest ever <unk>
What happens in the largest film ever <unk> is that all the top up at the bottom end of the end, has some brand pictures, all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not only going to have the <unk> of the brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we had all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe <unk> a shoe and becomes the most cool shoe that you've got.
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest ever <unk> the best upload that you've ever heard about <unk> from "The largest ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> make that <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the full idea -- all the film of beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people on that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you think about it, it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> How much money does it have to do this?
MS: One million and a half million and a half thousand <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth the shame to convince a couple of big markings on it.
<unk> who knows, maybe for the time to go out and look at it as a whole bunch of idiots -- <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: I both stuff.
MS:  That means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: And I thought I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, it was to present the product as many people as possible, make that so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle that is going to be able to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
There was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that <unk>
I like a way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: the free of simulation or <unk> <unk> or easily detected <unk> or easily <unk> that are characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest line.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to it, it really changes a lot.
But why? Well, transparency are <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there's he looking at me as a single <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in the story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just one company, a rating I want to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go for my mind, I would have to go back to the <unk> and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, big, giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make a big, giant Hollywood movies, they say the reason why their movies have so much success is because of the <unk> brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone can tell you, "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little bit nervous.
I want to help you to help you."
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for a man like to <unk> solid, to <unk> it on bar, like this.
That's the general.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more good a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind you to <unk> people is the reason why this is why it is.
MS: How words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you can get into the <unk>
Man: We talk about some <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It's really cool.
How do we keep you better <unk> more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: Get my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand.
<unk> It's just <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I suppose the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray colors, and so on.
I usually carry on the <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: On a <unk> part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is surrounded because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be a brand of Tom, but I often got myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These are sort of shape the way we see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that you think about, like the people around you, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and they start in a place and in my case where it comes and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to <unk>
MS: The next thing is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things -- I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what do we do that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> are you right now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your respect, <unk> <unk> A: <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what you're going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy crazy stuff.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but I put it in your <unk> personality -- Professor Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I think some companies are only going to lie in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the things that they're not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you are actually <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and <unk> those things that have gone and come from, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to take your identity identity, your personality identity, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you a very good <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes attributes are like being playful to be cool like the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> and bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic as <unk>
Or are you a lot of <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You are <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, stable, stable, good, safe, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how you now use MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movie.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to districts that companies are getting on their way in schools with information problems.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've been most successful are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> they took off their agencies, and they said perhaps these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And what has he gone? he was success?
Well, since the film was left in the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and so -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> or press, no TV.
The film is not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has been started to gain momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the rating agencies that we talked about with their clients not being part.
I've always believed that if you take risks that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take the people out of that to fail.
I think when you train their employees at the <unk> <unk> is preparing all their company to reward them for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
<unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Now more than never a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk, <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the <unk> <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're completely different.
But if we managed to put an effective virus for Windows in a portable computer for an engineer, to set up this gray, box -- then we are ready.
This is the <unk> <unk>
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enters the gray box -- <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we put our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively looking at the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant in the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a little bit and a big.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They would have all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, was calls in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world with potential goals of the real world.
We need to figure out how they could pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
You don't find several thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants among our <unk>
I called them and asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to be able to slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number line stands up in that code, you can't get it.
I started to research scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
And so there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been made after several weeks of hard work.
We had to go back dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would go to one single thing, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw -- really <unk>
There is the gray box and up the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the stock values of the sensors for example, of the sensors of pressure and blood sensors and providing <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by video <unk>
It's <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the steam steam steam goes on speed, you have to open vacuum tubes, in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can go bad things.
The plant can destroy it.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
<unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> that will disseminate this burden with a key key -- as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms.
We get the most possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such is attacks in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are very much <unk>
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main animal behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower,
There's one story, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you <unk> skills, or another one that would make chairs in the wheelchair and get a walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different than something that you put in the morning, it gives you a great force that will also increase its speed, and help you for example, manage your balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other entities, <unk>
This is not an idea.
To show you what we're working on, what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it is <unk> to bring even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human leadership.
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton -- I can save it by 90 pounds of variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
I actually want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the look at the users of chairs in the wheels, on what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in terms of <unk> in the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage in the column that they start their life -- the 20, 30 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is getting <unk>
Her only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> who's using Amanda <unk> who was using Amanda <unk> who had an injury in the column -- and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has a sensors ...
It was completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board, and here on the back.
There's some batteries that give the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when a strange jump in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
On a fraction of a second, I lost all of the feeling and all of the <unk> movement.
Shortly after, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last hint of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> it costs off rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented me and let me walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life for future generations -- not just of soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs in the <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> magazine festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of rainforests in the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives are.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot too focused on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforests -- and it has been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario on a violent conflict that has been rise for decades, and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The meat of hunting meat and deforestation do do not fill in a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard of it, hidden the trees, the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as the apes, <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the NBA game, you see the root <unk> the same laughter, the dance, and the ritual <unk>
The game is the glue that brings us together.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> ball, and I'm not talking about football.
Here is a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what it is doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, he has <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in Bonobos as well as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to be <unk> this is a young female -- a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think that as her, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> the most of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human beings, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, they can be the moments when it is the most urgent time.
So partners to accept this gift of evolution and let's play together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of the captain in a volunteer body.
And in our city, where volunteers are commissioned to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But yet there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what it was our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that surely went through one of the worst days of his life.
And we were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and he <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that he had just arrived before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came up to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building in the building to save a live living because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get the house.
I need you to be <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hallway, went to the fire firemen that at that height or less had finished the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house of the house where, to wait, his trove received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over what else was that someone had achieved even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a volunteer -- I am witness to be witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also <unk> acts of <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or they're doing -- levels remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get it back now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete block was built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules of a fixed measure.
Very quickly, these became the largest building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to every home.
It's estimated that you've made over 400 billion or 75 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be a engineer, to build beautiful bridges, or homes.
<unk> did it accessible.
It simply adopted the <unk> block of concrete the face in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the labs, Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on some other way to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create a lot bigger and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only to experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're put together via magnets.
So you can't get it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the pyramid, the blue is the stream, the pink is the entrance and the orange is in the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make higher circuits.
A blue guy with a green cause of light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, of pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to be able to connect and connect them together, connect us to program using very simple gestures -- very simple gestures.
To make it faster or more slow, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind the <unk> is that it is a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to get into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a daylight works or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers have no experience in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, just on cardboard, and wood and paper and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world that we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking at the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I know that time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
<unk> a few members of the year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World and we send them into the wild world.
They worked great <unk> worked with <unk>
His task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a parking lot in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I looked at a quote, but what really looks for is someone to be able to clean it when they are trapped by the snow because he knows it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to make help this <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and that moment we had a lot of the last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens are working with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can embrace a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, you put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
So, it has a uprising.
It's a modest app.
Maybe the tiniest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the Afghan government.
And it spreads in a viral way.
One responsible for the city City systems to see this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to have <unk>
It's very important that they work out of these <unk> but people <unk> the batteries.
So that's why citizens who are <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks on the time.
So now we know about nine cities that are going to use using it.
And this has spread without <unk> organic and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this isn't normally happening.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that the normal channels would have taken at least two and a cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the court of California that all the time has cost 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of <unk> warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think that it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the issue of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they put together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
It's not given to the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't have a lot of <unk>
And these people know something we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because they alone didn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government.
And because the government at the last instance of that <unk> -- remember that by <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way it will produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, <unk>
This is the heart of care and information center.
It is the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> in the United States.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, and put music very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a phone center.
It has a application, <unk> called <unk> <unk>
They didn't have that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my bucket bucket -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to volunteer education.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological definition.
I'm talking about a platform for the people to get away and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And I could have this connected government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think that you are the entrance to each other.
That our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will prescribe our values and change our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
At the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us that that we funded as something that is happening in our against, that other thing, and as a result, we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have been written by a very detailed report of 325 miles in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- is activism <unk>
And for the ones that have been <unk> before the government, is time for us to ask us what the world is like to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't get government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is possible with technology to be able to rethink the government function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not so hard to act -- just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years so I, to <unk> I'm a larger generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that all of us are going to do about who is going to live, they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem not really much matter to make you hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They lay hands into the work to program applications that make them work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be washing a <unk> out of <unk> taking a trash bucket that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also being a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in community communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
And sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would have no other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic <unk>
And I think that we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them feeling, they can have a special meaning to do.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the family of the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way the world looked like this.
She was hard but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I became so hard that I could barely breathe and then get me wrong.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I went back again and if I was saying yes, I stopped it in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room, and I looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him, and she was really serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, I went across the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said to me, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you something.
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know you've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought that and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never have any <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the rural South Africa, I have a brother a older year and a sister a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just had the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You guys <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> -- and you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
He said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
He went back and he went back and said, "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I say it by the power that is identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we need to get it out.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what was 40 years ago.
There were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black, you find so much <unk> so that it's determined by these facts.
One out of three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or the parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Indians -- Baltimore to 50 to 60 to 60 percent of all young people in the prison or the parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
And in this country we have a criminal system that is very much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is a wealth that affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We are <unk>
I feel interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work, some pretty curious.
In my state state, in Alabama, as in other states, you get care of rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black black population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be so high to the time that they would get the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world in the world of 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without possibility of getting out.
We're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row.
This issue of death row is interesting.
In some sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine people <unk> have identified one which is innocent that it is <unk> and they released the death row.
One rate of error, would be an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation you could never be able to be able to ever fly airplanes if every nine that you had, you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I speak about race and this issue of what we deserve to kill.
This is interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> I talk to you about slavery.
I talk to you about the terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction of the reconstruction of the reconstruction to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> you ask people to stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the first time with the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on with <unk> and decades of racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we had to go with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome race segregation without a compromise and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good disturbing to listen to what you want.
<unk> is not death row in Germany.
<unk> will never be here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we could never get into a systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> we put us into <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful they are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both of these things.
We talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so engaged with the intellectual,
With innovation, with creativity, development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are also <unk> by the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in despair and be <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is almost at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to truly be humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to <unk>
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity that if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called to me, to say, <unk> comes the lunch lady -- we're going to come together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was standing there listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, like, <unk> me who is that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
And we try to help the ones that have been convicted of them.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to finish with the sentences of life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in the prisons.
We try to finish the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and finally looked at me and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> he put his finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I believe that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
And so I think there is a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's it.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> really <unk> we don't judge ourselves by our technology, by our designs, not for our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way we deal with the rich and powerful people -- but by the way they treat poor people, <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they would be <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it's not it?
The judge was called an adult, but I see a kid.
One night that was very late was <unk> by God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should be able to ask for that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my black customer in 14 years to be treated like a privileged white <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there have been a <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
I woke up in the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or actually the <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> it was sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I was truly excited about it.
I went into the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down in the car, he walks at court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man -- was the <unk> of court.
When I saw me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "Is you <unk> I said yes.
And so I walked up and I was <unk>
And I would love in the ear, I was <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
At the inside, the judge saw me saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And we started traveling.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The cops are the cops and the prosecutors and the prosecutors and the <unk>
And suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and they're all right, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would just go through the window and listen to you all that <unk>
I was walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black black, with a face of concern, he walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> he showed himself because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and he said, "I would have this room for audiences to tell this young woman to keep his sight in the goal of <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up toward justice.
That we can't be truly human, if we don't care about human rights, and by dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And over the top of all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that I just want to tell you that I just want to tell you that you have to get the sight of the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see a picture of the audience, in this community, to help you do something.
Which is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring, that is going to be a <unk> effort that you can spend the funds that you spend today in more policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> don't get to anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, to the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest <unk> rate.
What would you say to what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in <unk> in this country is not for crime with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population is going on.
And we let us convince us the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain, to rob a bicycle, by small crime crimes against the property, instead of making it <unk> those resources into their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment is nothing about anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited us, <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, could be from the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses, our senses are getting a lot more data than the brain is probably <unk>
And like nothing matters to survive, the first stop of all those data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the detector of danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So from a <unk> of the stories that would look at the <unk>
That old saying, "If there is blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it is not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the <unk> of species, water scarcity and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long time, we just had with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average income per capita per capita income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food and electricity and transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy is about 25 percent more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living in an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity electricity, water, <unk> TV, mobile and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
So a lot of this is a lot of the technology and about its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the speed of quick computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law to the left, it goes up up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, the <unk> of Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> are called infinite computing, <unk> sensors -- 3D printing and networks, the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, and synthetic biology, the fuels and the fuels and the digital medicine, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw victory on the "Jeopardy" of Watson, in <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that we had.
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> to opponents here.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, that for all of the cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can be able to positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, it would have <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
This is about taking that <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with covered with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was much more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the organization is the <unk> of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal form.
It's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy for the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about harm, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we have plenty of water.
Let's talk now about the wars in the water.
You remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft on Earth, in 1990, after the country happened.
<unk> a photo <unk> How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of the ice is ice, and we fight for the <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you with you, let me leave you with your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small fridge in the size.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any source <unk> saltwater, water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The Coca-Cola president just thought that will make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it would be, Coca-Cola <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to reach 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communication in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton is 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have happened ever.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images, libraries of books and music, technology of <unk> diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market values with mobile phones.
Maybe the best will come up when you take health care.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce to the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the <unk> X <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the world teams to put these technologies into a mobile device with which talk, and because they have <unk> they can be extracted from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that will not be able to call the health for health and first to stop that the pandemic happens.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of nature.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of the <unk>
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never had to get to the global conversation.
What do these people?
What do you say? What does it mean?
And instead of economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health from a better education with the Academy Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we deliver three billion of the members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and to be able to act for the first time?
What does these 3,000 billion?
And if you are contributions that we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small, guided equipment, guided by their passion with an objective of of course, can do things -- things that could only do the great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish up with a story that really struck me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard about it.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how we fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this college professors, in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up, and they started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better than folding protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades of extraordinary.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that they were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It's actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it very much until the <unk>
Now the fish are in the Red Warner <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special stuff.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: change in the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned so much with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 centimeter -- the <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was going on for a good moment, so I was able to get it over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined in half.
I went to the five centimeters.
It's a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
And developing fishing development was imposing the countries that they already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty <unk> was called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South African Sea, and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains that are fish from coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a studio and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a solid background of soft coral, in this case, being a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living alive.
I wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to get it out, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they've never had fish.
But it has no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
It will take a place to start the start -- a new level, not remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the <unk> we have things -- biodiversity, the number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images that are <unk> in the beginning of their conscious life, like the normal thing and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk> of change.
And at the end of the end, keeping some <unk>
And that, in large measure, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies have been killing animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal which is very prevalent before they <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
And even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focused on big animals, and in an sea synonymous with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people -- scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do that, because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> like the captain as a captain of and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally the use of the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources.
There is the huge paper that can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because in the marine <unk> we really recreated the past.
So you know, the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a <unk> marine area and can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the history of <unk> why do they deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends manager and look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So what we're going to see now is what the videos are made by the viral and what importance has to do that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today, the web does that any of us, or our actions, copper notoriety in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
You climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of these, only a little percentage is viral does have a huge percentage of views and makes a lot of views and it makes a lot of <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of calculations of participation and <unk>
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, God mine.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of popularity in the summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this answer to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are showing us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, a Friday. You have to start on a week --  -- all you want to get on the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Wouldn't you think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency frequency.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from the nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask them for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends embrace a view of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
So only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation, animation with a <unk> music.
That's like that, that's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
So even cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats looking at the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet community of the Internet.
There were <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old one.
And then it became international did.
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> has made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form a part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk>
What script could have been written by that <unk>
In a world where two days a video days goes up by minute, only the really unexpected thing can figure out the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who did protest against the <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I've been <unk> by the <unk> but often there are some obstacles that prevent you properly from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and its humor, Casey <unk> achieved that five million of you see and understand your idea.
So this approach is worth everything new that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, that we all have access to and is the audience that defines popularity is <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't have permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media, but you have to have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit of unit and freedom in their country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> they were the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, is now going to do it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to be treated but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old, when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined to have a <unk> task that was supported by their family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> which challenges the fiction, a boat goes into the sea dressed in the warm ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we first asked us, we would take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> <unk> into every wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember pirates that came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to be able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights in the platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, end up the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tried -- given for the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of a <unk> class, whose population is dependent upon immigrants from immigrants from the population.
Unlike the suburbs of middle class, the existence of the <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the clips of English English is <unk> between people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree at <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they had a <unk> extra in English and mathematics, they wouldn't matter what it was supposed to do, which was generally <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of <unk> for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would lie on our day and give us the movements of our grandmother's moving home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until the nightmares actually started to be able to be able to get it.
She opened up a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry transition and <unk> and <unk> and children were caught between two worlds.
They looked for <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> relentless student relentless with what I <unk> myself.
On the other -- I was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> tragically <unk> by violence and drug abuse and insulation.
But a lot of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer -- he chose me the young Australian Australian female.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
As a <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee student, invited to talk about places that I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence I had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into <unk> and in the comfort of life in a suburb -- a grandmother, a grandmother, a mother and two daughters just end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when we climb the ship.
The "no" was never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What are you not going to be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking about -- I was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they are living on the edge of the possible.
And even though I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> in the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily be to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear the world.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people who <unk> can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, it was a giant array of soup.
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant ones, and we open up a step.
I made a decision to move to the U.S.
And after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
So three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before you end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered it.
Life didn't change for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose <unk> <unk>
No support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't make it wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a <unk> hotel when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked across the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
On night a monk and a monk was told that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
And I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Because the ones we were and how life built us, now we can see that men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have felt very easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that for you?
But I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a brave <unk> in every wave, the constant pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee you wouldn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it all and see it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the British singer, <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplane.
At that time when we <unk> the great Indian warrior -- I had <unk> he was able to pull a bow and with a <unk> on the floor, got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we had was that the machinery had replaced the truth.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to lose and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to be <unk>
My grandfather gave me his gave me his silver <unk>
And this kind of technological piece of 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door into a world full of imagery, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and the cameras prevent it from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I threw myself into this technological world to see how to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
You put text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do with it?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, "You know, your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I go back to a character of the book.
In a few times it comes up with a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through the GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl are excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that magic of childhood -- these ideas that <unk> from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned out.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to free the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what the friction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device within the device.
And this opens a map.
In all of the fantasy there has always been maps but have been cognitive maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another incredibly important thing to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary and the contemporary of contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts -- the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and moist book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's story.
In a history that deals with about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual of childhood you have to go out and in a chapter, you get a photo to a flower and then <unk>
On the other chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
And in the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on the video -- and <unk> actually sees a set of cartoons that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature are going to relate to technology and magic and technology is coming up with one another.
We <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects from <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What would you say?
"How can we care?
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale, it's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and moving forward.
Every morning I <unk> me.
And yes, I have a challenge like you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I read myself, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time that it needs <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going from their houses, and they take their blood pressure, they go back to their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to regain the control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us healthcare because of the challenges that we face, as the firing end of the care costs, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but it's also using <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video here.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe even we have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM machines are.
And also where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> please get <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to find the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> what you can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> worldwide.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I would also like to invite companies around the world that could help us contribute.
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in the place.
Please take care of this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my <unk> passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when you use the camera in the planning was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera on the process ends when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And even though it holds a <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say realism I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it happen.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in a certain way, can create something that still seems to be <unk> like it was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture looks realistic and I think they're all those in which we don't even hear the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important -- because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that keep in order to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the personal way, I think it's easier to create a place that will encounter it because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew that I had several months to try and find out the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made a red <unk> house at the top of the island for which it looks more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it needs planning to be planning on.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures that you can be very beautiful, and at the very realistic <unk>
All the tools are there and the only edge is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other people we usually see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
So this is a weird thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
They put more intensity because they write on paper.
Why do we have technological curves.
The answer is that if you draw it on a normal curve, in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to give you the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look for example, some other technology, like the transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport it is as fast as the <unk> last morning, we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it's not moving to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years moving orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves. We see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve, like this until something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
So in this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is: what is that new way you take the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel like something is going on.
And a transformation is going on.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we <unk>
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer computing.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time in which I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back about a half billion years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around it.
If we look at the way that chemical <unk> we give ourselves an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of the RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there was floating some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that gave them a particular combination of chemicals that gave them the outside of the outside and so the drops grew in.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> you have a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that you make.
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that in some way is <unk> being better at the time of bringing the chemical <unk> more chemicals -- <unk> more chemicals -- and they get better.
Mostly lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple chemistry, but the things get interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
We somehow don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the prescription of the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to record it.
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card I've got a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and would have spread in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years ago.
But then another great step occurred in which things got very different -- and it was that these cells started to swap and communicate information to forming their cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can swap DNA.
That way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be able to form communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community became more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities come very much that they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years to life.
And in that stage we have communities that have communities that are communities from many different cell types working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't play alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels of the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened in these communities.
They started to <unk>
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than processing information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell phones built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures to be able to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit, because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism because they had been built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit processing
So the fact that the nervous system made those information structures it accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that saves some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated about it in sound, in sound, in sound, and we make something very complicated in another brain.
That now lets us start to work as a organism.
In fact, like mankind, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we went through similar periods to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods -- presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> <unk> <unk> tape <unk> <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than what we did before.
Now evolution can happen at microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales over time again.
The first stages of the history that I told you took a billion years each, each one.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> and so on, took less than a million years old.
And beyond, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that job for <unk> would not be possible without the recent evidence.
But now design objects that would be impossible for me to do it in a conventional way.
I don't know that it does every transistor in that machine connections.
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine, put it in the machine and the machine that does something that does not do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes you use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using recently is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these random instructions -- to run all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to the <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the order right there.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you would better do the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we have the best <unk> the numbers.
And back to <unk> following a <unk> process to the <unk>
So let's take two programs, that we have to ask -- kids -- that <unk> <unk> and the children will prescribe the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software <unk> which had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's get it again.
We have some mutations to do.
And it tries to try and go back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated, in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that they are doing absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
These are weird programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal that they get the goal because they come from a hundreds of thousands of programs that do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I was going on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to deliver a <unk> flight -- don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make a different design process of design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things that produces normal engineering.
But we don't understand the whole choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use these programs to make computers faster and so they can run these programs much more rapidly.
Or it is <unk>
The thing goes every time faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now he comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a physician, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up some of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you know about it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to get to the first base -- not to get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who about 10 kilometers, you get paid four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> Major <unk> to run more 400 <unk> <unk>
Now I put this into my world world where I feel much more comfortable -- or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a <unk> place, and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor comes to a cardiologist whose record record is 200 percent.
But you know what?
She's actually getting better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you believe that must be the average of a heart surgeon or a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
CA: Okay.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a doctor or <unk>
What we do is, though, is kids in the world, and I included up with the <unk> of being perfect.
That ever, would never, ever make a mistake and convince them to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in the high school said that Brian Sachs studied to a blood test.
You know?
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses at General General in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, we <unk> the origin of the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> differential or <unk>
And I even knew the hard diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And you know, from the school school with the impression that if you were able to get everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lunch lady.
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency service service where I worked.
I was given to the service of <unk>
And when I was emergency to go to a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist to go to that patient going to me.
I will inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the <unk> lady, I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which gave me a heart failure.
And in these conditions, the heart stop and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are lots of blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
And I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read it.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water pills to make the liquid <unk>
And at one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes there.
I sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have to be able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to be able to make a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I sent it home, I didn't recognize a voice in my inner inside that he would say, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unable to read the nurse that I was asking for the <unk> I would believe that it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yeah, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as it was yesterday.
So he signed up with the tall, and the ambulance next to the ambulance with the ambulance on their house.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I would be able to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that time I did something I don't do normally, I do normally, I did something.
It happened to the emergency room service on the way home.
And another nurse, not the <unk> of the lunch lady before, but another one was told three words, those three words that most emergency doctors in emergency emergency.
Other specialists who fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: it remembers you?
He remembers the patient sent to his <unk>
And I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By an hour of having come home, after I gave him the high school, he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure pressure from <unk> which means a shock severe.
I barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
They put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I expected it against all the hope that he <unk>
And in the two or three days, it was clear that it was never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they would get to what was happening.
And by the ninth day, he stopped her -- the wife, <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the few weeks earlier, I was struck by that, and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and even more makes that mistake.
It's that shame that gives a teaching.
Shame <unk> that I'm talking about is that it makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I would do the things and make sure I didn't tell me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent it home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
<unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day <unk> he opened up the sky and finally came out and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you get the efforts to be perfect for you not to make any more mistakes, I would leave those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an emergency hospital in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent it to her home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my chief head asked to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: remember you?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
He went back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He fortunately, it didn't die.
You would get antibiotics for it <unk> and you recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same time of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work in a hospital, because they went to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a calculation of <unk>
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking out the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand room and called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
I read the fluid for <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk> it.
I looked at it and when you see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand room, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered so well.
But every case was <unk> I was shocked.
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
I'm embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this to make the same <unk>
If I go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time to look at it in the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the errors.
It's the system that there are two <unk> who make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that I know that they have <unk> results and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we make care of medicine to people who make mistakes going to be a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a intensive care study, I have done a intensive care study, and I have a medical study to learn how possible from the first article that I wrote for the <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every 10 drugs that one in 10 drugs are wrong, or <unk> is not right, in a system where the bacterial infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing the chaos and death.
In this country, 8,000 Canadian medical errors were <unk>
The U.S. Institute Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is going to spread every two or three years, and we don't get rid of it.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes with <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get rid of, and we eliminate all the most likely professionals to error, well, it will not be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
On my <unk> <unk> white <unk> is already a custom -- I would say this is my worst <unk> I would tell you all, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students will come up, and then go down to the head and watch saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And he starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, they know the human -- they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We had mistakes in other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and of support for all of the <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am human, they would make mistakes.
And I feel that much but effort for me to learn something that can convey to others.
I still don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many choices we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose to a week?
I recently made a survey more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick up a half American American, is about 70 a day.
Not a long way ago at a research followed for a week of a bunch of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time that we were able to make decisions about these tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you <unk> the way that we deal with those decisions?
So today I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
On the other way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question. You're ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and <unk> and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we got out of the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why don't I buy anything?
This is a shelf from the oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that were coming from <unk> trees.
And I decided I decided to go to the manager and I asked him to get this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed out to me on the buses with a tourists coming up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
You put it up to <unk> right to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and looked at two things: First, what other people were willing to stop and test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent of the time that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of the ones that had stopped when there was only three percent got to buy <unk>
Of those who stood when I had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six of them that if they were in 24.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> it's probably good at least -- it's good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choice is affecting us very well <unk>
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for retirement of about a million Americans, from between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of money <unk> available plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 choices.
We found that the bigger it was the number of <unk> funds, there was less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of involvement was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there is unintended consequences.
So for the ones that decided to participate, the more of the number of choices, more people are being used to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much as there was more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial curriculum.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, the decisions even when it goes against interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in the finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively you get better.
The main reason is that we were looking at the <unk> of looking at that gigantic array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations in order to try and choose that amazing <unk>
What I want to do today -- four simple techniques that we have done in a way or another, in different research, so that they can rehearse in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You heard it before, but it's never been more than today, which is more than today, which is more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're looking at is more time is that if you decides to cut, get rid of the strange <unk> choices, there will be a <unk> increase in sales, they will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I eliminated the products for junk of cats -- that less <unk> are raised by the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> bigger sales and lower cost.
You know that today, on average today, you have 45,000 products.
In a Walmart shop is offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce
In the financial savings world, I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage better options is the <unk> David <unk> the Harvard.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically at a insurance fund.
The people who really want to eat, are offering 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't make their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience to a holiday with the most paid road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Right. Whatever is ready to accept the deal.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second place, but I can tell you that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the problem of the behavioral overload that is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very carefully <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem like real money.
It turns out to be seen more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we were looking at exactly how we did it, we did a little <unk>
What we added was that they would take a staff to the staff who would think about the positive things that they would do in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their bank <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a corridor of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> along the corridor of the <unk> the display of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> exhibitions of it.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> I'll give you a <unk>
<unk> That's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> I'll give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This method is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something that they <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of fundraising.
Who are they going to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> the complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than what we think, if only the <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a car manufacturer of cars that allow it completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to put out the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is we need the order to make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go out of a lot of choices, 56 colors, just a few short boxes.
The other half of clients are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about it today.
If you have the <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to ages, <unk> the <unk> button over and over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where the information is presented.
If we start the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of the box is not to say anything about the preferences of within, in all of the ways that are making us a choice.
We are excited about a product that we're building that we now have more <unk> in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternative alternatives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can manage more categories at least <unk> <unk> the complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced you were were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you to use them in your own business, or for people who work on.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1990s, in the East Germany <unk> if you had a typewriter that I had to write it from the government.
I had to record a sheet of example of example, written with the machine.
And so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that someone could do this, how much this will make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer in any big manufacturer and print it on a page, that page will end up having some yellow <unk> on every page that follow a pattern that makes it one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be a lot of <unk> for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the net.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can set up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are actually a lot of <unk> cases online, which will make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, the <unk> and so on, and so on.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by <unk> banking money to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a computer <unk>
The U.S. secret service is two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know their <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most Algerian crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, and they motivate them the protests, they motivate them, they motivate you.
Now as Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying an endangered role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national states that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of an attack attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of the Netherlands -- or it actually was.
<unk> the <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
Did you get the security of the site and take a <unk>
I asked, at a meeting with representative government representatives asked one of the leaders of the Dutch government, if you were to <unk> <unk> death of people who cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do they do for the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> headquarters for the secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> the building, they found a lot of papers.
The other papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that portfolio there were notes in a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company in the company is right here.
That means Western governments provide the tools to the governments that are <unk> to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this as well.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
They <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these obvious answer should be said, "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's <unk>
So privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we ever heard today, will be forever.
Are we blindly talking to any future government, in a administration that we could have over 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to care about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the South Side of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my father at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences in the most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out in the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> believe we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to protect them, and so we value them.
So I grew up with <unk> a lot of the lions.
They were dying of the warriors that protect our community and the livestock and they are also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, from the age of six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought to lions was fear.
But I realized that actually it didn't be <unk> because even he helped male lions see the pen in the way away.
I didn't love <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
It was trying to cheat the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  -- they came the first day and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he went down and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch where it turns out, and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp, a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery gets the electricity into the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights out.
As you can see, the <unk> give outside, because that's where lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to the lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
They are <unk> You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used for all of Kenya, to frightening other predators, like hyenas, <unk> and also being used for <unk> elephants in the farms.
And because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a fellowship at one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the homes that don't have it, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> cows of my father, and he used to see planes fly and told me that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer in aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and to the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on some other electrical inventions in it.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they already invented electrical fences but I want to make mine.
CA: So I heard it once, again, right? I've tried it before, but I had a couple of <unk>  CA: At the bottom of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it on every step that you know, my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No anything."
And I was feeling very proud.
In school, we would go all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that the Americas, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Although sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from the colleague of my sister.
That he said, "When <unk> -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten it in the two last weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we are ready to die."
It was very altered.
I was the first time I heard people were suffering from my country.
At the time when I walked in front of the railway station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms in his arms looking at his face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine, <unk> from North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during hunger, and just few survived they survived insects, insects and tree cortex.
It also became more and more frequently and more frequent energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> at certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life was like as refugee refugee
But soon I learned that it's not only really hard, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear of that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was shocked by the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> so I would <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and ask my questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a false <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are <unk> in <unk> <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can be <unk> in a second.
So after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what I would expect.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Poles.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Although we got to life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to go to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities came up with some money sent to my family, and as blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a position to clear back into the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how I help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately he believed me.
We did all the way up to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I made everything to liberate my family, and we were so close -- but my family was <unk> in prison by <unk> of the South Korea.
I was going and came in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family free.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I would love with all my heart, and I said, "Why do you <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the people <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
I was kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the people who are <unk> when you get it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> village needs to do.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with little or any money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices in work, and so on.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are following in contact with family and we are in the way we send the information and we send money and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is Center for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so the city planners came together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles South, as if this is what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  --  -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans, in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center, to the home of food places to wear and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that food places to bring kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases, in Los Angeles South Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times bigger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I think that it will happen.
And I ask myself, what would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of your house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs from wheels and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides in it.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> strip we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by 45 meters by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me on it, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to run it out.
So my group and I, L.A. Green L.A. set us together and we started planting our forest of food food, trees -- you know, nine full vegetables.
What we do is, we are a kind of <unk> paid group, made by gardeners of all the <unk> of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city <unk> me on top of me and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that he had to remove my garden, the <unk> did <unk>
And I said, "Come on you?
A <unk> order by planting food on a piece of land that no one was like,  And so I was like, "Well, let's get it?
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even call it to say that we <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on earth does it not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
Your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
And I was thrilled to be part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You will be able to see what the earth can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an educational education tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You will be able to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came to a mother and her daughter, <unk> like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden. He went out and looked very <unk>
I, man, I felt evil that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people will go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid to go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to be <unk> but at your time, I want you to raise your <unk>
There was another occasion when I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the middle of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant their mom and their grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
This is how Green <unk> has come to plant perhaps 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people coming from, work and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If kids grow up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if you are not taught how the food is affecting your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're caught. I see kids who are on this way that are designed for them, that it doesn't get them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity that we can train these kids who were getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take container and turn them into healthy <unk>
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people out of the street to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Take your <unk> take your <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, you don't call me in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a kind of <unk>
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in the days of today, where it rains too much.
You can have a huge amount of water in asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go on your bike, and these automobiles go out, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads as in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a quiet path.
The solution for that is <unk> roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a <unk> material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so that all the water water flow toward the sides and you have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't get the water anymore.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, the whole noise disappear, so it's a very quiet highway.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that it can be <unk>
What is <unk> Look at the surface of the surface of the surface on the surface of the surface.
So first one stone, then various more and more and more and more and more and more and more, and so forth, and you can hurt it --  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be turned into a problem, but we have a solution.
You can actually see the damage in this stuff.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- the <unk> this <unk> -- this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if you get off, you're going to be <unk> and you separate from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel -- that to clean up <unk> and we can cut off the steel wool in smaller pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially the steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel of steel -- melt the <unk> the flow of these <unk> and rocks go back to the surface.
And now I used a microwave oven -- because I can't bring the great <unk> machine.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to be <unk>
So he gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to do a lane of trial to test this stuff.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take many samples of this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, we know it then with our <unk> machine and we repair them and we put it back into it.
We can do this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers to actually increase these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even they can double the lives of the surface. It actually will be able to save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity that it worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool up before I can show you how to show you how it does it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was telling BBC BBC on his little gray radio, gray radio.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually about it.
"The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what a <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban ran out of Afghanistan, and they were illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was shocked, as a child to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be used in the outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could be suspect to where do they go?
We had to hide books in stock in the market to make it look like we were shopping.
School was at a house, more than 100 percent of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we would get our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school closed suddenly suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it comes from.
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. It <unk> that his daughter, my mother went to the school, and so his father got it.
But my Congolese mother was a teacher.
This is it.
It went back, two years ago, just to convert our home to school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that his children had to get education, even their daughters, even though their daughters, despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember there was times when I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in your life.
You can steal your money. You can get them to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay for your education, we shall.
So, you don't want to be <unk>
I'm 22 today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family would have been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud of graduating from college College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate their daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry him driving over the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I had a big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador, <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the hard desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like my friends, we would get to them, despite them, despite them, even though in front of a <unk> opposition, <unk>
As <unk> is not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> into his village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you are the phone -- a voice would notice that if I was still sending your daughter to school, they would get it to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've got to realize in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> girls who went to school they count -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It would be that these changes didn't last long, after the retirement troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would give it to me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother's words who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk>
But never going back a revolutionary <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of rage and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the middle, the fall of regime, carrying billboards for freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to reach the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East to the West, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses from about 50 thousand people -- we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've been dear with, along with many other women, rebuild the <unk> civil society, <unk> a transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation to the national reconciliation of democracy.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about development development and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders, orientation -- to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right of engaging in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, shortly by recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques old and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the murder of the murder ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news murder of the army.
And every day, every day, we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> abuse of human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up for a revolutionary mindset -- more -- and it's taken away from the ideal and principles of freedom, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> that became the iconic of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our history of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm right here today to tell you that we, as a nation, choosing wrong, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the elections didn't brought the peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> brought peace and <unk> <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies and <unk> and <unk> for men like for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the election, that just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the more likely to need the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as mood agents and call it a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also to put it in practice the mercy instead of sustaining the collaboration in the competition, the collaboration of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> by war, needs desperately to get the way to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> has the same root in Arabic, the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that goes with all the humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all the tribe, and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so as the <unk> is completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine array of compassion -- it makes it all existence.
So it goes, "My mercy goes on all the things."
This is what it is, "My mercy is <unk> about my <unk>
That to all of you are giving you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a unified question that has an answer as well <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the ones that all make a great thing, why she is left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, and not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor and editor at <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> Black <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many times, a lot of times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me to hit my head with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved someone else in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a symbolic <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in the University of Harvard and I have an MBA in <unk> from the Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the <unk> list of <unk> <unk> among these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I've been almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence is going to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> and <unk> relationships or <unk> or <unk> or, in the families, the last place where we want or expect to find <unk> reason for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that he would sit with a man who owns it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age of age and girls in that age are killed every year for partners, and <unk> and husbands were <unk> in the United States.
I also got a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and rainy night in January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most at that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed a guy in the field.
He had a big <unk> like apples and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it all over the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
So we started out and I loved all of me, which was so that I had gone to Harvard who was passionate about helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the arts in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought that I had to make sacrifices for your spouse, and so I got to go, I left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that it was falling into a <unk> <unk> that I was getting into a physical <unk> financial trap carefully ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that site where they were supposed to be so sure was that they bought three <unk>
One was the <unk> in the car.
The other kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in smaller.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those <unk> actually were a message to me, and even though I had never lifted up my hand, my life was already in danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack on <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I got the girlfriend suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happy to always, because I loved him, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident and it will never be hurt.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
I was driving the first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that we had a number of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey. He went back to the traffic and threw me a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> it kept a year or twice a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three Americans is a victim of domestic violence or harassing at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I love it?"
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that I could help <unk> to deal with their <unk>
The other question that everyone does is: Why just don't you <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the most sad and painful question that people do because we are the victims, because we are the victims, we know something that you normally meet, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the killings in the cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent bullying -- even after the <unk> has gone back to married, and even after the <unk> has gone to the victim of the <unk> and their kids, who normally are obliged for judges to spend time not to spend the man who would <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why they're simply not going?
I was able to go and go back from one last <unk> and then beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family -- all of my friends and family, all of my family -- and I'm here today because you all get me wrong.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines, <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that they prescribe their lives of joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of a very typical domestic violence.
I went back to <unk> with a lovely man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do to have ever more, is ever a <unk> gun to my head in the hands of someone who says to me.
At this moment, they are thinking, "Wow, that's <unk> or <unk> which is <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there is a few people who are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or that they were <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting their daughter, <unk> to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love, particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse only in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the <unk> to the light by talking about it with their children, their coworkers and their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic and <unk> that they have a future future.
<unk> the speed of violence to grow consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of it, secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have got me dressed in the room --  fortunately, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothes on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me as just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. are very much less <unk> I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to go through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh for me, so I don't do anything as you cover my mind.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this photo.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would <unk> the back and put the hair out of the guy.
Of course, except with surgery or a <unk> that I made me two days for the work, there are very little days for the work, there are very little to transform our way out, which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> also the <unk> to a high and <unk> shape -- and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing you, and maybe there are some people who are <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for learning is so amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York I told all of them and every single models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can I be a model when it's important.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what would I really tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If it was after this spectacular list -- I still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, so I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of the American <unk> or the executive executive of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that is like to say you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to prove to you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have a lot of your studies, and you have a stick and you have a stick and you have a stick and you have a couple of jobs on your back, no matter what you want to be president of the United States, but you find your house for 10 years, the people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture I told myself, and the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know that we are entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
And so I was looking at my grandmother's grandmother.
These two pictures are from the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and in <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professional <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> people -- and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, let's make things for free?
I have too many gamble from 20 inches and I never use, except the privileges but the privilege that I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a light in red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for being able to keep going.
<unk> of these privilege that I think of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their matter what they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of <unk> teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black black and Latino men in New York City, so for what for them, it's not a matter of me, <unk>
I think about how many times as well as I <unk>
When I research this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the age of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure out to 78 percent to 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a business model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit more bright and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it would happen.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say before the cameras, what I've never said to them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair will be happier.
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs the most bright hair and clothes more likely to fashion but probably the most insecure women in the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to hold this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
The photography has been my passion since it was more enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more photos -- and I didn't know the <unk>
There was no <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum of <unk> in lighting.
In fact, most of you take a random tourists random.
My story begins when I read in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife took this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That is the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to happen to come back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can see what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take me to New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started asking tourists that were going to happen to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never one has been <unk>
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This photo is from a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in the way that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, as long as we take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it feels and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with an illusion every year.
So recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> in the baby store that <unk> from small views of the <unk>
And he described it to the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively being in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always one that pulls the picture.
So today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't want you to get to someone and asked him, and you take a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the printing press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with the <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And so my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who found mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> of the Middle World -- where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 facing a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important first place, they give them ecological ecological services for <unk>
They're our <unk> <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria to be able to absorb the promotion that it will not be for them and caused huge losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with the old culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the upper and the bottom Egypt.
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they are very important in the open <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there is no place to bury the dead or wood or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the extreme end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they are being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities are using this poison against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical critical list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey in the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge time bomb, and the number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the <unk> Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk> birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a locally, and it's not going to do anything.
We need to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking about them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can be active to make noise. It can write a letter to their government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to your families, with your kids, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw it without effort, without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, which the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we <unk> would be <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where we had just decided to teach people to grow food.
So we got with seeds and <unk> to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River and we teach the local local tomatoes growing tomatoes and Italians and <unk>
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because by what they told them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were observed that the local in such <unk> valley, had had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you about how it was possible that we were not going to do it, you know, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> for time to save the people from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato grew to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> look at how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> God <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it? You're never <unk>
I thought only of our Italians would make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, they did what they did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we gave the <unk> people from Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars over the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about harm that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners -- we are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot."
I deal with all of a different culture as if it was my <unk>
So whites in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said for about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the man who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that isn't <unk>
I decided to the age of 27 years just answering people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never begins with anything, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> the <unk> of becoming a better person.
So what does you do? It's <unk>
It never reaches a community with an idea, and you feel with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We sat down in a cafe.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do this?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that the man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell the people what to do, why not do it not, for once, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never come from, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money -- what opportunity have <unk>
So the planning has this blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't reach their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face -- you have to create social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the doctor of the business -- who sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen table in the coffee, and it helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this condescending junk where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk> and <unk>  So the government says <unk> <unk>   So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business consultants of the story, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business -- and this is what Peter <unk> said, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> company.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now we have <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most popular people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come into a conversation with you.
You have to give you to you, you have to be <unk> to the <unk> and then you're going to get it in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and <unk>
What are you going to show you guys more this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we have no renewable fossils -- we have no renewable fossils -- we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a very beautiful story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> this group of people came together this group of people, and we were able to do what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the bottom one was <unk> New York City wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population gets growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> --  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in the United States is <unk> generic manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there was very few of them -- <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to be <unk>
Otherwise they don't come to talk to you with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute, <unk> service.
And then I said, you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and find the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have looked and looked at the 100 icons of the <unk> world, <unk> Ford -- all new companies -- Google <unk>
There's only one thing that successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started for one person.
I don't know the word I, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small business that come from <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who asked you, what needs to you?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memory from our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our communities and make it happen.
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant giants that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There is a <unk> in New York <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest number of U.S. abandoned properties.
I live near this house, and I thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and so on.
And this has been a profound gratitude for the time and the time I lived with this.
He gave him clarity to the meaningful things in my life today.
But let's stop for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to be easy to be left to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends actually transformed the wall of this broken house on a giant <unk> and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day, the wall was filled and was still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I have died, I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I have died, I want to sing for millions of people."
I had to die I want to plant a <unk>
I heard I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I had died, I want to give you once more."
Before I have died, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes for people who made me laugh at <unk> I was <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways, and it's about to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have been done in the ground in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age, in the increase, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is a little bit of a <unk>
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will give us more power.
If you think about death -- we have our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect the better what matters as individuals and as community and more means to share a community and the more means the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
I don't talk about, but it gives you joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> will happen what happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice in this -- it's never <unk>
When I singing our childhood songs of our childhood, trying to say the words that I didn't even remember it, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would be able to pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normality, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though that was the case, even if you didn't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing that were <unk> people and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests himself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different about Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, we are being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that are faster in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating whatever it was in the <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child that I saw the world without biases, a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens to the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them are wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what it's right.
If I could give it a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be not normal to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inside and frankly, the search for normal, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Why? I'm not normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications professor, who would give a communication of communication to engineering students.
I was scared --  -- <unk> really <unk> of these students with his great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when those conversations develop those conversations -- I felt what it would have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door in a new world.
I just felt like this, I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was shocked the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to have also this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges -- from energy to a health care environment, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please love with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive to it.
First question for <unk> and so what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when they're describing their science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is a hurdle for our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> is not the same thing to make them dumb anymore.
Rather, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate its science without engaging the ideas.
So one thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- and they are ways to stick with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about signs of <unk>
Have you been wondering why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> are killed by the <unk> and the bullets are killed by their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's not just a boring, but it's not just <unk> in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- which is that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can give out graphics that we would go through our other senses, and create a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is the science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English studio is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an <unk> publisher of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that looking for an audience and no matter what he is looking for a <unk> or -- and when he won, it gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk>
I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try <unk>
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words of the exact words that were said in the <unk> chamber.
And all this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put it in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to actually show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
Didn't you know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They had all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it the <unk> of the <unk> and other people, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was from being old.
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for King for a given <unk>
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired of it, because this debate was going to be <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want the Washington to get rid of power.
They didn't want to call him King for him or his son, ideas.
So, they wanted to give it the most <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> than it was happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title. There was already before, but it just meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who do you take a very ridiculous degree and <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> -- the President.
President Barack Obama has a kind of lucky to keep out there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for us to go for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and this is that the President of President of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads at disposal, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of soft vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have endowed the title of <unk>
So I actually won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance -- well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the House of Representatives because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to give you to you.
politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really change a lot more the words that these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at a <unk> mine in a living mine.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see it much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male <unk> and stones with the tools that were primitive.
As the other ones I carry out, I have a cheap <unk> of light -- he holds his head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole that hold the walls of that hole in a meter falling hundreds of meters on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met a <unk> that he lost the control and dropped a <unk> <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are in the depths of that hole risking their lives without pay, and often, dying.
I walked out of that hole and went home but they will never do it because they are <unk>
Over the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the G8 of the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGOs which is dedicated to eradicating <unk>
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was the world in the world, but not about the <unk>
When we finished talking to me and I was very sad, I was able to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a little bit like <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my trip to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
Sometimes I considered them my second home.
But this time, we will take the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are currently more than 27 million people in the world.
It is twice as much as the number of African Africans during the whole thing about slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary in a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of the <unk> of the <unk>
However, today, you can unlock entire families for generations per year per year per year per capita <unk>
Well surprisingly, slavery generates over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promise of good education, better education, better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but the ones that produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, women, children -- in fact, entire families -- <unk> mechanically ventilated <unk> bricks in their heads down to the time, and they take them back to the time, and take them from the <unk> furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> not to drink, and the severe <unk> would make it pee very <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was too hot to the touch, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't make it here."
And it explained to me so clearly that I will demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't owned by that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his liberation and he trusted that he <unk> it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks for miles on a <unk> land to trucks that they were waiting down.
Those great <unk> were heavy than the children who had needed, and the children would put them on their heads with <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to see something that <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had left their homes.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness I advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously previously used sex with.
It took me on a <unk> stairs that would give this dirty basement <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> like it's known in craft, they are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms, where the <unk> would be with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each put it is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a <unk> fear of and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be being stuck in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the steps where they were going.
There was no <unk>
There was no windows enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because they touch a topic that hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even the sexual <unk> is happening around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slave
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families that had been built on the trade.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands of black are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay ourselves our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a look very fast.
I saw what appeared to be a fishing family in a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families -- <unk> <unk> and forced them to work on a long time on these boats in the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of trees immersed in the <unk> Lake <unk> they often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to the water to release the branches.
A lot of them are <unk>
<unk> has always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run it out, and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one.
<unk> <unk>
And it would actually point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi feels as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to put it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would love to go out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path as barely visible and he said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that we would <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put up in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in a course, and we had in front of a mass holes that could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up with their back, and, while they were looking for gold gold, they were looking for <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to 90 meters and these people carry out with heavy stone bags that then they'll be transported to another area where they put the stone so we can extract the gold.
So the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look at more of the fence, the margin we see work at least <unk> and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> per few years ago.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him on the mines.
When they die their uncle, <unk> I miss the debt of the uncle who force it to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, he had worked on the mines 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so that the doctors said that I had to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and it was forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being released and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of purpose purpose to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll be testimony to them and we'll do everything else to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves about each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to be <unk> <unk> like slavery.
These images are not from magazines -- they're people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that happens that I don't think about these many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in who you see them in people like you, and I hope that force turned on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math -- and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like management designers.
No one knows what the hell we do.
So today I try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We would get rid of the <unk> of mine and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But the demand is a degree of extraordinary training a high level of dexterity and probably a certain initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous dancer <unk>
Over the last few years has moved a lot in the treatment.
And yet, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and an objective <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement has no biological <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic -- what if the patients could be done by their exam ourselves?
It would be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars at the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to suggest, as a kind of conventional <unk> you see, in some sense, at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of elastic ropes.
It shows someone healthy while it <unk> sounds like dancers of a musical dancer because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes required.
And as the <unk> requires a pretty extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of vocal chords as they <unk> and so as Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
You can see this <unk> example of elastic ropes.
We see the same <unk>
shake <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both of them are <unk> but also the exams based on voice and they're not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to us.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it comes on mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to help in.
We can reduce their patients from patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic for routine.
<unk> we could get objective data.
We could make a massive <unk> for <unk> for the first time, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
And so by giving the first few steps in that sense, we're launching the Initiative that is <unk>
<unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices across the world to get enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's -- you can call it under a price and put recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already achieved six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's get all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can't afford it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of the confusion in search of the real <unk> of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
It was much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to have a fantastic work and now has shown that it works in the mobile telephony network as well, what the project is, now we have a 99 percent accuracy 99 percent of accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> audience.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> gray.
We were <unk> in the dark, in rooms with no windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models that are still more perfect -- the perfect skin -- we may be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be possible -- and some of us are really artists with a talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and the photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw it from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was going on in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> where I worked as part of the answer team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay in the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
This is a small fishing town in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people who were affected by the wave.
The <unk> water level had reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles a land.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We had the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime mud and we leave the ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and <unk> cards and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of peoples around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those photos represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up the <unk> toilets, huge <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of that day and I had honor that day to be able to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I'd heard about the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years that were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and it knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the following morning, the following morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl -- it was <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would look like that, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, it was lucky and more <unk> so that I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a neighbor of the north of <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the temporary computer libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depends on the <unk> of the photos.
It could make an hour an hour. I could make a weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw almost in hand using how the areas whose color and detail the water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures made in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, all over the time with the spend time with the time I continue to <unk> that was a big part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was <unk> dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We have a <unk> neighbor <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos are already <unk>
As once he said <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make any mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> it but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not be able to <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the full picture.
When they collected their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble pretty far from where they used to be your house, but your colleagues <unk> it.
The tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go into the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took him a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photographs his younger son was 14 years old.
For that, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that would have been marked by that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us at <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more of <unk> photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- the vast majority of their own <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 hundred and hundreds of photos and <unk> and <unk>
So for this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> 1,000 in equipment and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A photo is a picture of someone or something, one place, a relationship, somebody loved your loved one.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us but the first thing to look for us.
This was the project, to restore small pieces of mankind, from bringing someone into the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that you're given.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger, to bring something, using their talent to something that they don't be thin models of perfect skin.
And to finish the end of the email I'd like to read this email that I sent back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the imagery.
And one in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me -- because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother and daughter <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us inspired to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple exhibition in a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion -- but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos on the slow motion of the light moving.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> on the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays and defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it into it and put it into a <unk> second, and in various <unk> to create a photo package of just a millimeter millimeter millimeter long.
And that <unk> <unk> that <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> it in this bottle, how do those photons inside this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, this whole thing --  -- remember that all this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
<unk> I didn't have this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photo package that starts to <unk> and which, in the way, starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces out inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights of the top it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common and <unk> and we make the same distance away, and we see it in slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much they think would take us to sit down to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film --  of a remote slow <unk>
And what about how about testing it <unk>
You can see the waves coming from the table, the tomato table and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
This is the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more time, it will realize that, as the light <unk> of the tomato keeps brilliant.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it comes back after various <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera on the MIT?
Like photographers, you know, if you take a picture to a <unk> <unk> it goes very little in.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> so I barely get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over again with a very large <unk> and we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in the crude and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see him after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. I want to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could get those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We built it.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in the Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good temporary resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what dot corresponds to what a distance.
When projecting a laser can actually record a photo in raw, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple light <unk> and with that, we will be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that would make collisions with what is on the <unk>
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected in the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, and so actually this is a request to scientists to start thinking about the <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of health care in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became science in art, an art of photographs of pictures.
I realized that all the data <unk> that we collected every time is not just for scientific <unk> but we can see that we can see.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between each one of those waves is just about <unk>
But this is also a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are moving from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events in the world sometimes comes into the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can have a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song and move it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this moment, this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they would be looking for change, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
Who do you have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's very much, almost everybody has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my cell phone, and how it changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 percent of information lines.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information out there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission I presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This board says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider, every single Internet provider, has to store a broad range of users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends you a text to who.
And if we use the cellphone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in his telephone company, or his Internet provider,
And in all Europe people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone phone and the <unk> Internet service all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, "We don't get <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that at that time, I was the greatest telephone company in Germany, who please give me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't have a particular answer -- it was all blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to put a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, he <unk>
They took the demand and they send me the demand for me to <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly piece of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk>
I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive. Okay.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go ahead and go forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me a few friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one next to the other, and you end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate to each other, what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see this whole thing.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who send you an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, I had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, the government agencies and companies want to store as much information as possible within and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to take care of it forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends <unk> your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and that is not quite any fashion.
When you go home, you get to your representative that just because companies and government agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that will give you to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.

Just through accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in here.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.

16 <unk> <unk>
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal on it.

I am from Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York City, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the "Don't think.
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> dance.
If my three major sisters.
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk over the five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another puzzle that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a hole <unk> which has gotten a lot of <unk>
At the way, there were only six Arabs in my city and was all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs -- and they continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate using <unk> to the <unk> like <unk>
The people that I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of starvation during the <unk>
I would tell you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so that <unk> at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay the physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we were not going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get into <unk>
On the summer vacation I often tried my father tried to <unk> so I drink warm milk on the back, so I would drink warm glasses on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I was thinking, "You know, <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with a <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive affirmative and I got a fellowship for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I went into all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
They all <unk> me.
I made all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk> <unk> will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of the end, he was <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper   And they gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> I run the head of the theater, in the theater, crying and crying as if somebody had killed my cat, asking why and she told me that because they thought it could not do the scenes of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the insurance stunts either.
It was a paper that literally had been born and they gave an actor without cerebral <unk>
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
And I went back home, and I went back home, and my first tour, it was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the career directors are not <unk> no white, no white, <unk>
Just take it to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the ruler.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
And in my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when she fell at the top of the <unk> on the New Jersey highway, with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I am the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my father of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the New York City Festival in New York City, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind the principals directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program <unk> it has <unk> with Keith <unk>
And I walked in, as if I went to a graduate school, I would tell you a studio and sat in a <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the <unk> desk <unk> in the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like, I was <unk> and pasted my chair.
And something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me and no longer as a child and no longer.
Suddenly, my Internet disability became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
What does it have?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disability is the -- yeah, <unk> man.
The disability is the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I didn't get it, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I grew up with media, I don't think it was <unk>
I hope together together we can create the most positive images of disability in media and everyday lives.
Maybe if there were more images if there were more positive images -- that's less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children well.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world -- "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Palestinian refugee children a little part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me living alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
It lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives a small village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it's going to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunity, there are no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day he is about a guy who gives him to <unk> him after dinner <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to be bought new clothes, money to send home to his family.
They present to a young man.
They finally house.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb car.
That kid in that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist <unk> and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little child trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing he pulled him out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated into urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the <unk> urban <unk> who were unemployed riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of jobs, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the history of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence -- will be the history of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that <unk> hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to put the juvenile leaders in a high business.
<unk> to about 90 Syrian juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a ideas of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
I had no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a college <unk> college -- frustrated, it was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the highest obstacle to reach point A is the street.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
They started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and their dream is at some point expand to hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> and I believe that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
It was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative to do.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and even recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the abroad.
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is:
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outside of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could they survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the young people, the young people can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't rose because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the genomes of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO to work for the government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of the change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas true.
They need experience and orientation to protect them in development and set up their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need to do with the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, private spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park, the <unk> is how it is called, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the chance to escape from the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and you have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of the <unk> an area called the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the sheets of <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings on building that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> Lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed of the shed was a <unk> of about four square meters with an apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> aluminum <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk>
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how a <unk> or where you get the <unk> who clean your trash <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
So here in New York City, the Department of <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and two tons of products made every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I interviewed the <unk> and I interviewed people in office and facility in the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed more more <unk>
So I started working like <unk>
I don't just ride in the trucks. I get the <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you can get it very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> to the weight of taking on their tons of trash every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> the <unk> <unk> is one of the 10 most dangerous ones in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into the traffic all the day and they go down around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general, the driver is not paying attention for.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that <unk> are the most important labor in the streets streets for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient form and effective and effective every day, this starts to get away from your container and your dangers inherent care in very real ways.
So we have <unk> for decades, and centuries they come out and start <unk>
The economics needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old way, we don't have room for what the engines of the economy start to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just put into the relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed we need.
I mean simply at the speed that you used to move in the <unk> time.
Usually we don't have to be able to be able to stop it, and we have to be able to get it out, or we have our coffee cup of coffee, our stock bag of the water.
We use them, we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will take away from that.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the <unk> that maybe you can help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And his job allows us to make our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in a way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste on the road, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste collection and I went back to this man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that he was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account every costs, even the very real human cost of the labor labor.
<unk> waste that we think when we're talking about trash, it is three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistical statistic here.
So in the flow of their day and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is clean up the trash of you -- you would give them a moment to get it out.
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming a part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from the conditions and the local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging world, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city to realize that there are three important aspects of <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the skin with <unk> generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it is a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees per year.
And thirdly, it does not have anything to do with Africa not with Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really awarded the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space for generating external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a very building a building, several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the location of the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that now we see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> atrium, which creates a space in the open air in the building that would be absorbed by its own way from the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution to <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric like a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light from inside the building to illuminate the building by night.
So with these ideas it didn't be easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what we want.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center because at the end of the bank was more profitable to sell.
And the idea of the facade was much more inexpensive -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was thinking about how to make the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity would be cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to put it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of the meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which actually collect water for the inner <unk>
It's expected for the early year, since we go on the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a very big project, the biggest thing I have designed -- I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that particular analysis of the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen different access doors connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was broaden the existing streets, creating 12 early early blocks on size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick some strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation, it was thinking about the cell, the little cell cell -- like the <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's make a framework that claims that most apartment are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And also it responds to local norms that set up a higher density at the upper levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can upload it and make activities like running a <unk> career for the morning, or jumping out of a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging world, where you can see the cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same pace that grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as objective to connect the nature with the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> I was a little late and I hid in the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's book, <unk>
And then, I did.
I put up the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit like this.
And I set up to <unk> the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and I just put it up there -- just because of being there, because I <unk>
I'm still amazed by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt doing it right now.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's all obvious <unk>
I never got stuck.
But above all, the reason I really impressed myself that this little girl was so small, was so good for <unk>
I was <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also the primates. Those birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there was no enthusiasm to say that if there was no longer literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
No Shakespeare.
<unk> the lists of reading the high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy there is no <unk> I know that it's fashionable to say that you have the answers for everything, and, in terms of the plants, you almost have them all.
This year is 100 years of their work, "In looking for the most <unk> study of the <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> I did, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forget how hard it is that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the enthusiasm that they reduce the person to their desire, to their <unk> are a proper narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel enthusiasm we tell ourselves a story.
One story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
As a <unk> and <unk> we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the knife right?
The <unk> do we do all novelists <unk> and that's something that they would understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> senses in his lover -- adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that they were <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break into it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it a <unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
The <unk> information <unk>
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big amounts of bright hair, and the cute little bit of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why <unk> is so successful --  -- <unk> links to the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of jealousy suddenly listening behind the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of their lover -- so it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different at the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's some scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge -- a really painful truth, in fact, what they are going to do, the more painful the good the best.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us suffer, causes us to become a range of much more profound and vital feelings that a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other emotion of it, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about it later on.
One day, Freud had been visited by a very <unk> young man who was used with the idea that his wife did it.
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, not <unk> what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or then accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the more we are, we are more of us become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> are taking us to make violent acts or illegal.
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since that they sent terrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge if we make creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like an Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> -- Mr. <unk> books that try to deal with the <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy the membrane that separating what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to <unk> your self and get it out of what some time <unk> and it's under the ground -- you get the name, you carry your rings, your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they are before a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but he does it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it would be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of six <unk> once you come in, <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as a geometry, not excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute of the next thing is the same way.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so easy.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate it to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
<unk> fiction -- the jealousy.
The fiction used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying one -- Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the book module.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray surface of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest deal in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave the job to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which walked after the death of Armstrong last year, is the most <unk>
So why would we care?
They had not brought a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why do we <unk> the cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why does it work?"
Why do you turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why do we scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> that was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the transcendence of the technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of the technological Globalization list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> the <unk> and it was eliminated <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew crew flew 40,000 miles a hour.
Since 1970, no human being on the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> of the Apollo 10, and the optimism optimism about the power of technology has been transferred to what the technology would happen as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't belong to the Sydney exhaust.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was totally sure that I would have to see the colonies on Mars.
So that is something that happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists that were <unk> and they had been enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the sell.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years in which they were <unk> sometimes, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to give their own entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused that the creation of <unk> ideas -- by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture venture capitalists were at its peak without worrying about the risk -- the little investment -- the little investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and developing a long-term capital -- have never invested in the development of technologies intended by trying to solve big problems because they don't have any immediate value.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we get a <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would take a political decision that was popular and that's never going to happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't fix the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy like solar, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and the economists agree on what policies and treaties on what politics and international treaties -- the development of a <unk> energy increase in the research and development of energy, and some kind of price control of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they're not going to be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in the delivery of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and food shop, but there will be famines as bad governments.
And finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president is Nixon going to declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some extremely resilient ones to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have been found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need that, but these four elements have been <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to fix the problem: the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The mission <unk> that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it is true with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and the dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, is a very widespread optimist.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will bow to me that it may have declined in some activities or institutions and that could have gone up in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to the surveys of view, and the opinion polls are allegedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there's not a lot of evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty <unk> including nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway half the road.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes, that people refer to when they do certain questions.
<unk> on the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asks you <unk> <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I probably heard by asking, "What do you do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put the confidence in a <unk> manner.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we are going to feel like a certain kind of a certain kind of a certain kind of official or a person, and it's going to be uniform in all of these cases.
I could, for example, I would say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the type of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we left all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> manner.
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust -- because they try to <unk> the good <unk> trial in fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think that's stupid.
This is not the goal that I <unk>
I want to get more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is not.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I believe that those people who are doing their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
More confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
It was deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, yes, it says yes, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to make a judgment on how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if you are not responsible we could not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't get them into them to bring a letter into the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would make their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do that we are looking at before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> which will be <unk> in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we need the system of accountability that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I think you all know the similar examples.
They put all of that, by the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were to think about being worthy of trust, and we would give them to the people that we are trustworthy and if they try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple action, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
And we went to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve the trust.
But the trust, ultimately is defining because they give us other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough for them to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't get it down by all the people, all the time.
But you also have to give some evidence evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That makes a day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions -- very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- says I can <unk> without giving explanations anymore.
I take them and get it back to the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great, I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good evidence that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end of the end, I think that what we're looking at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
And this separation has been <unk> increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the glass of the glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
So I started to imagine how we <unk>
And I first created this tool that <unk> in a digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body.
The designers can put their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands stay still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the entire dexterity dexterity in your hands?
In the <unk> division of Microsoft, at Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a transparent bombsight with cameras of depth to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift your keyboard, coming into the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy as taking a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the virtual Radio sensor that is below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
And in these examples, we have to think about the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come toward us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make it physical so that we can be <unk> and <unk>
How would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel in it.
This magnet <unk> is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And when we program digitally digitally released from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach you physically and distance and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality that you want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike <unk> or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating that changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as a part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to be <unk> in our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only threshold that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After the survival of the Cultural Revolution, they believed that there was only a <unk> path toward <unk> a safe job and <unk> work.
No matter what the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be an Chinese opera singer here.
This was me in my imaginary <unk>
An opera singer has to start <unk> very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
All my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew I was just too much <unk>
My dream was never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life is a second of the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was that unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
<unk> books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that were doing here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> tries to live Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda for a lot of <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but it was strange.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It's so different, and much better than it <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and <unk> relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture was also given to my reading <unk>
We have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map I thought it was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to fields of research as comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offered the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> by the <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Alan <unk> Instead of getting lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that it was going to tell me that <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I don't feel like I used to be used or <unk>
To have a <unk> dream is nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex entered the first session and he walked into the first session, and he came up on the couch on my office in my office took his shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class partner had a <unk> like first client.
And I got a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't.
And with the stories of <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move the head as it <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said Alex, and what I saw was, she was right.
You start to work after that, you start working after, you have children after the death of the death of the death on the death of the time.
For the <unk> like Alex and I had been <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> <unk> to press the Alex who would talk about his life.
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they get away.
This is what psychologists call a <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they were made, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in the development.
This caused the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect time and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of <unk> benign problem was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody gets to adulthood without going to go through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. It is all right.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be 35 years old.
So this means eight of each 10 and experiences and experiences and moments of experiences and moments -- that they shape their life will have spent for me when they have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people don't stop <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends its second and final stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change yourself -- now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life and we know that female fertility comes to his top to the age of 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to take care about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday and common life has an impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the ones are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline, in the time of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> would give you the <unk> names of the <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you get a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's not happening.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and absolutely nothing.
And then all the day, smart intelligent people like you or your children and children get to my office and they say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm just not killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while he starts a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better press the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My dates during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, and then at some point around 30, about 30, it turned on the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stand standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the ones there?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit of extreme -- but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave so many things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, and to have two or three children in a very short time period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are some research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career that you want now.
You see that you can't have the son you want to now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the ones are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At the 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or the entertainment, but you could still be decided so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
And then they were often in our <unk> but then they woke up in the way that they say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head on his legs and cried for almost the whole hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then I was seeing the empty space that follows after the words <unk> -- please call it <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to be able to resist and I didn't mean <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as I just sit while the <unk> was going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told him three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves know.
First of all, I told him to Emma give you that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm looking at the exploration that shouldn't count, that by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the ones that get together with a similar minds with similar minds are limited to whom you know, what do you think about, how do you talk, and where do they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always come from the outside of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak links friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half -- no, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
The half of the work has never been <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job that was not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last but not less important, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon get to his family when they have a couple and form their own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better old to get your mind that 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live on now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook starts to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
Your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just doing it or to be able to work or kill your time with anyone who is <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> <unk> of a prime who worked on a art museum, in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who lived on.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not enough enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in their trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, the age of 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even on the next generation.
Here's my idea that is worth spreading all the people who know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling the <unk> as he was Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> and they use their weak links nominate your family.
Don't let you know what they didn't know or what they didn't know about.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very expensive job in training for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teaching them mathematics in seventh grade in New York City.
And like any professor, I made tests and tests.
Let me assignments.
When the work came, we would have grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and worst students.
Some of those who had better performance didn't have <unk> I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in seventh grade, safe are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time for time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what we are going to do with the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied the <unk> working in the very difficult slums -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the outcomes of learning their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking us what these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all of these very different contexts, we came up with a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the PR schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who do my questionnaires <unk> and then waited about a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination was significantly more likely to get rid of the <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the previous test results -- even the security of the evidence that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or at the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for the children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about the determination is how little we know, how little science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we make the purpose of <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a solid work ethic.
How do I keep them by the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related or it's even related to talent measures, jobs.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that at the University of Stanford by Carol <unk> and is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons,
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most favorite memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
So since that time, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that anyone who would want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every single character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic scientist, 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy of basic literacy of the basic literacy one.
The first 200 will allow you to understand the 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signals from traffic signals, menus of <unk> understanding the basic idea of the web or the newspapers.
Today, I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might possibly be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was shouting <unk> I am <unk> This is a symbol of the form of the called, but I like to believe it is the other way. One that works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> in the old West <unk>
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are company, three are <unk>
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> it <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's an insect as a <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
You put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- <unk> of remember, as a rubber tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two protein together, it feels very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun goes out on the horizon.
One door. Get a table inside the gate, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two of them together, they're <unk>
Three together, they have care is <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical approach, will let them build them 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountains and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you to get out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I rather like to be my dad is the films I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician <unk> together.
The film was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand, and take a magic wand, and take a magic wand, and bring a magic wand, and take a bright job.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial <unk> a computer fantasy show.
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't work.
The trend really took rise about 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy would be a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a great difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the <unk> magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the Oz magician, you do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the <unk> of Oz like prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the armies were used by the computer evil computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing in the <unk> magician, is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years old.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the surveillance level there was <unk>  And so on the room and she was struck by the room and she was struck as a mom in the room, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It would have the feeling that Luke get one military to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> <unk>
How do you make Dorothy your film?
<unk> <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It is the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with, OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much domestic capital force in the movies for our kids, and so little on the way of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have served to be able to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first woman that I really expect people to come up because it is the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they guys, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves with the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend their <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies from war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to come up in classic after classic, each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
So far as many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the critical is when it came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet messed up and they are already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book of comics, and in the '80s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend of the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid who do so much like that?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that you <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film is happening in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes from men who have profound conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists of them.
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage of the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to run this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what she said, "That's what she said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's what he said, "That's
And in the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistic -- one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the guy who says that the paper of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very cool statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools that we have tools like <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, it activates or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power.
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to make something really important, and here I mean mostly the parents.
I think we have to show our children kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star character -- you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these mean?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that they know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to protect them to their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories where I tell my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories where I see that their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for fortune cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're <unk> and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I was struck by <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles away by the <unk>
My fortune cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place -- it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activity of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old city, old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Roman Empire. About 4,000 years ago.
The place is in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Roman Empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient <unk> <unk> art and religion.
<unk> have always known that it was located in there somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> it into the red circles, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is huge, it's about <unk> by <unk>
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this one and covered all the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try and find it at random it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes, and using baseball games.
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this high area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we're looking for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that date from the Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and <unk> and <unk> which proves that there was a workshop shop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but it will take place in a near future.
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Roman -- probably it was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the largest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED it wasn't founded in 1984 <unk>
Do you know that ideas really started in 1984 BC. in a lost city not for much time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that it's made.
Now we put a group of obese <unk> <unk>
They are competing with a <unk> race in and they go in the direction of their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around the place, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in the places that are <unk> the threshold of the front line.
In the lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with hands.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go into your mouth.
<unk> on a side and enter their living room.
Because in the room, and doing most of their imagination, you can imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on the center of the center, singing <unk> One more More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick way from the oven.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that gets done every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, which I guess, was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- they look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens of strangers.
We make whole poems for whole minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize higher the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be an phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and have one of the best memories of <unk>
And I asked him to tell you when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition is they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using an old <unk> invented <unk> years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, well, how did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the competition, and <unk> <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English English and brilliant man, and he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of training training on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I am not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
Or you have to start with something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year -- not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what is their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that will allow us to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the <unk> <unk> <unk> film <unk>
We went together in the public library in the Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on coming back, a number of treated about the memory of writing is about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and disciplined and <unk> it wasn't just as rare as you can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, they will provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they have changed.
We have changed, and I would argue that they've changed as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places in our planet where you find people who are passionate about this idea of a <unk> disciplined memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there are skills like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a bunch of researchers from University College in London invited a bunch of memory equipment, to the lab.
They wanted to know, to be that it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory and the memory of the control issues that the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine, <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They <unk> or seemed to be a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
<unk> <unk> is moving as an armed race in which every year someone has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 miles of cards that he is about trying to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only <unk>
He used a <unk> technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used by the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says the following. I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, "Do you have a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
You know, what would you say?
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
And with all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have meal in their hands.
They are very well when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when we get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this next two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him like entertainment, because earlier, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring it to a <unk> you would get to a <unk>
He stood up with his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies into <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the bottom of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his mind in his mind, I could see where he had been sitting in the face.
It took the family of the <unk> hand, where they were their dear ones in the rubble.
What you have to pick up at the time is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names, or <unk> instructions or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and extraordinary memory.
If you tell you, the first 10 words of the history I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do that.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse and some brown rubber horse, you would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and see images with the things that you want to remember. The bit more <unk> we think, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk> be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treated of memory <unk>
So how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to make it from memory, the same way that you would have done it, if you were invited it to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And you will come up with some sort of absolutely crazy image crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they fly in the kitchen, and the room that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year -- and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is like <unk> <unk> <unk> the word <unk> -- not word by word, which is going to confuse but, by typical <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase <unk> it would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something that's extensive about this <unk> competitive idea.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> boring.
Actually, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was a fun <unk>
I would never wait to be expected to see it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is actually trying to do is make more and more of the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my training standard of training competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> covered with tape, just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back back to the same contest that had been covered a year before, I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute power and <unk> and on the phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just little <unk> <unk>
Because they are based on the very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory like it was trying to be a gift of it, but it's not the case.
Great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You know, when we focus on deeply <unk>
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us.
It was a kind of deep processing -- a kind of full attention that most of you are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, let me tell me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> don't pay attention to the human in front of us, who walk into our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about it in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex thing, so you have just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my father's house in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everyone was going through the television page, so every time I went from my room to the toilet, everyone looked at me, and every time I came back, and I would come back in a towel that I was looking at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and he hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Okay.
Those feelings, those emotions I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and the division of areas, but of those areas of emotional <unk> emotional connections, which we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Agency of Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
Or it means 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it for based on a building building a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that they use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time ago.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the U.S., in the U.S., we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round thing, empty brick -- the red brick -- which is trying to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the <unk> the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both <unk> are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the current living forms of life.
We sort of push it and we sort of push them so much, that we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you believe that we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go connect with these symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we make the pendulum behind the back and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we heard the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Very hard.
So we zoom in in the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know that we like and <unk>
And <unk> <unk> and added bake we used new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> and we turned it into skyscrapers that can be <unk> medieval <unk>
The shapes is <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in business centers, we moved into the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can make our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French, or to the Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They are easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, learning memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now have new design techniques by the computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that we get into other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> you have totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum pendulum again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, he opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> <unk> and public <unk> they were completely completely aware of a building.
The New York Times newspaper.
<unk> in Bilbao grew in a half a half percent when the building.
So suddenly everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these <unk> wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them and quickly learned that these shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing made the main mayors in the world.
So everybody thought that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the new universe happened with other architects star.
And I went to <unk> and the <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through the entire architecture. The digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't look very much time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings more, before you know if what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until we get in both extreme extremes almost in <unk> and actually the difference between innovation and symbol, among us, the <unk> and you know, the public.
We can now make a little bit of <unk> emotional burden with an emotional burden of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product -- there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images in a building, it's the images that you made the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to upload these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building became done today, first <unk> the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experiment, about innovation, what can it be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there's no only response to what a library can be in today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions is the freedom to experiment on.
It's different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and you're not a public audience, and you don't accept something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get rid of <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum pendulum from one way to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the former city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of an historic brick of red brick in ideas of what a <unk>
So this means that some robots can build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami -- where Florida, it can also serve to make sports or <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Coast of New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more and more intelligent and more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on the opposite direction.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there is a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it to the <unk> spaces -- the local libraries the homes where we form our kids, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does it in that cool way, typical of the children in a year, <unk> like their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives himself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom realize I used to do it, and he asked me to think, when stopped doing this?
How is it that we don't really love with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because even though his mom tells him all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it is ugly.
What his mom says and what his friends, or colleagues in the school would say, "You don't know who to believe.
So it does a video of it, he publishes it on YouTube, and asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager and that gets these answers at one of the stages of their most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We had never been so connected, so we can get very young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that is <unk>
This environment is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of what they believed and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between a life online and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it is or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is actually rigged digitally.
What is the most important thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a every single day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls in now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what the young people do?
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the sports <unk> and the singers.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to look at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They're critical activities for their growth as human beings, and as <unk> to society and the developing field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three people are not interested in the discussions of the classroom, <unk> to participate in the classroom in the classroom because they don't want to call attention for their physical <unk>
One in five are not attending at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable on it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't believe that you're going to be thin, you would get a smaller note on the average of your peers who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it gives it irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you not about how you really are.
The lower self-esteem of his body is <unk> the <unk> performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The adolescents with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, involved in more diet not healthy than they can take to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all about this for what they make more valuable decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drug consumption -- <unk> surgical surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and not protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of if they have no higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to develop the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six <unk> <unk> the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be critical points for anyone who was willing to provide a education in self-esteem that works.
One education is fundamental -- but solving this problem requires each one of us to take the reins in the issue and let's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
They challenge the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the input of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of a <unk> athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see it.
All of us can begin by doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time I <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as companies and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow to be valuing the whole person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the great screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you see that you can never get them to be the ones that are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
You <unk>
You <unk>
You <unk>
They <unk> his <unk>
Could it just be the woman who is just two chairs from a distance. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, that he would tell him for not having long legs -- you know, <unk> a more <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for me if we have to make this potential for her to be able to make his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> to all of us.
But <unk> our children the truth.
I assume that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them and what they do, and as they make us feel.
I took the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, they become the agents of security agents in themselves in the morning.
So let's do it.
On November November 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> rabbi -- the leader of the Environmental Defense League <unk>
At <unk> initially they were, but being a prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning attacks in about 12 cones from New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't be rid of it.
Later it was <unk> it would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as being a <unk> engineer, with a love <unk> a <unk> American mother, in the two of them did all the possible for me to give me a happy childhood teacher.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
By experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to wish for the same things in life.
However, in all human group, there are always a small fraction of the people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the means possible for everybody lived to live like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going to <unk> on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go on with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he <unk> gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise everybody, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went into the other and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such son.
And all of all, the comment was a lot of laughter, but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a <unk> with 700 kilos of the underground parking lot in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
His name was <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability for my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was already a moment of packing and going to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white but being the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent the time on home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> for growing <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I'm going to give you opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like your race or your religion.
So, how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my proof was about the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program in which I participated in the National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids we had done was a Jewish person.
It took several days to come out to the light and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I was very proud of being able to beat the barrier that all of the life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in the Bush -- a <unk> park.
And I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience turned out to be fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most gentle and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way as I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is being homosexual but I know what is to be trial for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart asked me to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and he helped me see that race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In a lot of shapes he became my fake figure at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that preserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone who is to try to bring the violence to violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there is a better path to me, even though I gave myself this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the other hand, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk against these <unk> acts as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put me here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, tastes and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, like a childhood moments that project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the film, you're you who experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a internal film, you and you.
There is nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have an awareness of your own.
I'm not sure you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science by nature, is objective to objective it.
<unk> by nature, is subjective stuff.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would see that vision.
<unk> psychology is quantum behavior, quantum neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but never ever mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what do they look like?
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
without offend the <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problem with consciousness.
It doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
So why is this internal <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like the <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do they work <unk> how they work <unk> and they adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- all of these are questions about the building goal.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions in the human brain as an arbitrary phenomenon -- how do we talk about how we speak, how we do <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that all of the behavior is accompanied by an immune experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, really doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I came to the conclusion that that was not working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stand at this point.
We have a wonderful explanations chain, great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I believe that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our vision of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need some ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem for consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a sort of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what we need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs to <unk>
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely theory of consciousness purely based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to just denying the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying as the observation of consciousness for that.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the <unk> pattern space, time and mass.
It will make fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties do not explain in any more basic terms.
On the contrary, they consider first principles, and that the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, time, time, <unk> laws of Newton. So <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, time, time, time, time, time, then you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental brick -- a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts the space, the space, the time, the <unk> processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want to make fundamental laws so simple that we can put them on a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can get them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness may be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> -- every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs mice, dogs even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> I can be filled with distress when they think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought is that maybe the photons can have some element of raw feeling -- you know, some very primitive precursor of consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would anybody think something that <unk>
And in part this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like the others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuous with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Now there's always information processing, you have consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, consciousness in a human being.
<unk> of simple information -- simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a math measure of information integration, which calls <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a <unk> degree of information integration, the same pretty significant, degree of consciousness of consciousness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles -- the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
It actually has a fundamental law of the high degree of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers have found that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlying it.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From the view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that it puts it in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential for <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think this is right, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms, and the moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system from Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has an complicated complicated information processing -- so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right -- they have very serious ethical problems about the ethics of development of smart computers and the ethics ethics of <unk>
And finally, you can ask for collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have an TED collective consciousness for this whole group of TED, different of the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that must be taken seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing that is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we eventually will be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile. This is an underwater profile.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up with my parents because he wanted to be a community store.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice but there's an obvious problem.
She actually didn't get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had an underwater profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Now, years later, I was in the second part of teaching at a <unk> school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a few good minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs in the wheels, they talk about things that are <unk> at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had been having experiences with disability with disability and inspiration.
And we are not. And it's not from the boy, it is to say, that's true for a lot of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I'm going to play what I do in this wheelchair chair -- and you probably are waiting for them. Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've been lied to the disability.
Yes, you have sold the lie that disability is a little bit of <unk> A <unk>
It's something wrong with a disability and living with a disability makes you believe.
It's not a bad thing and you can't make a fantastic <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hands of drawing with a pen holding out of the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with a carbon fiber facility.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> inspiration, <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disability in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been <unk> <unk> expressing that they believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I'm going to stand up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
So these images, those images are attached to people with disability on the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
It would make some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was struck by the so-called social model of the disabilities, which tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of their capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common thing.
They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a fountain of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold to this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability in the moment.
However, I don't know that I'm fortunate than I am.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall down --  -- <unk> the clever trick of how to upload the battery of the cell phone on the battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a button has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen won't make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> the <unk> is not considered to be not considered anything to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people who are <unk> to be <unk> by getting out of bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in the age of 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about it that does it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about it, they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to <unk>
The first step is what I carry <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is run by the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds -- we were trying to deal with it all their self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I put some videos to show you what is using the Google <unk> under the shell, and you give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is an underwater going up on the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- a little bit of a moment.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> of <unk> mice. mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> and <unk> can be seen from the angle of a <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how do we bring it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you know it.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not cheap enough.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and doing a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of it.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> pushing the ball to the bottom of the network? Or you would be able to do a <unk> <unk>
What will be your experience when you walk from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> reality.
<unk> reality is augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick test on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> on his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put corresponds on the <unk> of the <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was more quick, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player to go to your group, and you see their next you're going to be shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have a <unk> you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or for memorize the strategy.
You just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> strategies <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people on the bottom.
You also get information about the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
Bad <unk>
This <unk> good teams of the bad teams.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It would also be for <unk> Who would have it <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's <unk>
It would be the ball.
<unk> an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you get a defense behind you is going to <unk> Typically, you don't know it, but the <unk> system is <unk>
We had the protection.
Another <unk> you would tell you that there is an open heart.
You get the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you look at it, but the receptor sees the receptor in their bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
<unk> takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
And I'm going to do that lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We are going to use it just as a bread and it <unk> like our <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality for empathy between human beings, to show someone who is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenue, a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or a <unk> or Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk> notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> like the time of us.
Thank you.
I recently went back to me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I passed the country on the southern end of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden <unk> was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a <unk> chief engineer, to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But since its openness, more of 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, as the decline from all of it gives you all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down bone, some of which we have a vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that don't normally get in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will realize the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest moment, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had this day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 of Julius last year by receiving a call from a possible subject, suicide is sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a <unk> Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to this up from New Jersey.
In fact, there was two times before the New Jersey and trying to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew about the history of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could get more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> he leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind and smart guy, in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what she was.
The parents of Jason had been doing it.
The damage damage from suicide are affecting a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved <unk>
What do you say?
Does it say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen.
They hear to understand.
You don't have <unk> or you say to the person you know how it feels because you probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask them is, <unk> in the similar circumstances have thought about to finish their life, have had these <unk>
They would go to the person in front of it to save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and that they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation, and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing the more moments of realizing that Mike didn't really go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> game with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and we would get it as disappeared as they disappeared that night.
And the next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car from Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too much weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before bad without suffering a real mental disease.
It should not be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
<unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call by a possible subject in the front sidewalk near the northern tower.
<unk> my foot on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he was immediately <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and half the next half of the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to that lane and give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out, it <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he did to <unk> and gave it to the hope and the life is another <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, mother. And I have that letter with me, and I would like to love you."
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th 11th events and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I'm going to tell Kevin when I just had six months, completely unconscious, all of all those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as the says.
We give God for you.
<unk> <unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of the end, she writes to <unk> When I went to the General General in San Francisco that night, you know, the patient <unk>
I knew I had it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of the society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspired others.
<unk> is not just something that I've ever found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, an opportunity to meet me.
This is what caused suicide.
For most people -- or those who consider them, they wouldn't think they hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is getting only three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved with I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And for that time, I was left in three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that most of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, these few who have jumped from the bridge, and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second thing they leave side the railing they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do is something that everyone and each of us must be <unk>
The suicide can prevent.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner inside, you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you tell you about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone at all.
When I became a model -- I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever been since a child.
My outside is finally <unk> with my inner truth with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to go later, when I look at this photo, I'm thinking, you got this picture, you know, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that -- I'm just beginning.
We all become our families, our religion, our society, our society, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the courage to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I just recorded me like <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wear this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why would always take that shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to do it.
The gender has always been considered a <unk> fact, but now we know that really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I'm never going to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be what I'm a bad way, but why the world is all about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who take me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture, which celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever participated in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was over the <unk> of the <unk> and the client, and that night, he won in the bathroom, he won in <unk> and she was third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was about the beauty of women -- but I know I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my mind for the green card that I could get to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk> queen of it.
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I gave him two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied by me when I was interested in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do do the more sophisticated surgeries and secure.
So in that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to do the surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> he lived in his life, but <unk> he put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November we make a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and it stood in front of the injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more <unk> of 20 <unk>
My most profound truth led me to accept what I am.
will.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you --  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. You know, thank you for all my <unk>
And to my support network, my parents especially, in my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called, and they told me that their parents could not accept it, he took my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it would work, it's not. It's not just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender of an gender at birth, and what I try to do is put a gender on the table that sometimes that <unk> not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are generally known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in the 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the history of women is the history of the <unk> of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when when you born a girl, your birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome or his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to their <unk> to the mother and no one <unk>
And a mother was <unk> a lot about having a little girl.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the <unk> mother, but the daughter just <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and your school goes home to your siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes in the adolescence, when it is 13 years old, he is a guaranteed to come out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his siblings and his family, and if they <unk> the code of that assumption of that matter, the could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only the life of a <unk> also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters.
And there's a norm more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl that has to be very <unk> very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It is supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly -- even if they don't will.
If the <unk> with a man who don't like or if the <unk> with a man old, has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If <unk> very young, he has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when she was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I was thinking, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she was there, when she was four and a half and a half years ago, the <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a child in a school?"
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in many developed world, but in the poor countries, in the poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and your name.
One applied to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future lives.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the <unk> <unk> form and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason that value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've put all these good values in my school and girls in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of the involvement of women in all the political and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls are banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls were <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up, and he raised the right to education.
He wrote a daily newspaper for the blog blog -- he offered her himself for the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and October nine of 2012, 2012, was hit by <unk> on the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell you the ear of my wife and "I must <unk> what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please, don't get you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the fact because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe headaches because his facial nerve, was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow of my wife.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile -- and the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please don't get it."
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that even though it's an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when you don't have his task.
It's fight with her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People say, "What's special in my <unk> that has made so bold to <unk> as brave expressive and <unk>
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google <unk> group where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science science, I did it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still <unk> or not?
They're not going to be like this, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And then after the operation, I had to decide what quantity to do about a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to stay alive.
More than once I've saved me for little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to try to get the <unk> dose, because it really doesn't have a clear map.
I started to try <unk> different, and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the dark dose, dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was myself, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case, for a few months, and I tried some doses and typical chemicals for a man in front, and I was just surprised by looking at how we got my thinking.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person all over the world, and --  of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of them are <unk>
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, it was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that I had in front of the front, and it just wasn't going on.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave myself a new appreciation of men on the men and what they have to do -- since then I carry on the men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so it was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking about all of the images, and that became my key <unk> how I can get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> and new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now today, there are people who ask this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works -- for me, is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the thought of <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a cinema director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to make this is just to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, an MRI MRI -- to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at a image.
The <unk> column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine seeing that same image is <unk>
Now, let me share another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
And in this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they had their brains to create a large pool of reaction to the video sequences.
And then, I showed you a film with new images people, new people, new animals, and as long as they have a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain information on the scan of the scan of the scan of the scanning of what appeared that the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
So this let us be <unk>
We're very close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you can imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same <unk>
This has been done with the largest brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull. introducing electrodes.
I don't give myself the one.
A lot of people are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, more <unk> magnets only offer little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of bigger magnets -- we make better magnets.
We can create more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI they were to do really big, big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the grasslands of FM radio, in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field, we can have domestic magnetic patterns, structured magnetic patterns.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns -- we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into the layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I've mentioned and perhaps neural neural activity is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas into a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be compelling as a tool for amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few choices more than open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His name is probably telling some person for the first time he loves love, or saying to someone who is pregnant, or saying to someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have in your life.
Everything in this room is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and come out of that <unk> is a universal thing.
It's <unk> and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side -- I worked in the South Side -- and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> I didn't know my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> that by the <unk> of my pants and got my head my head <unk> I would usually ask a child to say, "Hey, you are a kid or <unk>
And there was a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father of the <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold back to his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and it was <unk>
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to go into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
The Gloria <unk> dating.
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
So I would take a deep <unk> and I went down to my back, and I went down to my back, a little girl with a pink dress looking at me, what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you're a kid or <unk>
And so I took a deep way back, again, I put it back close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a little bit troubling.
I have the short hair like a guy, and I see a little boy, and I see a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable friends.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl of a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas. is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was it. "Oh, good. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how a feeling is living in a closet.
This is how my penis is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why I get out of the way out of your mind, but this is the <unk> it's hard to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has taken online bank is harder to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder to tell your child five years that you're going to <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, only the hard.
We must stop pretending what is difficult to be hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what their walls, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen because of <unk> in a corner of my <unk> <unk> my gay, and moving only a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers who I've spent my entire life on trying not to do it, and now the world was going back on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> you kill you.
One of my <unk> launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people knew that it was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I came to one where the friends were my parents' friends, people who knew me about years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I screamed at <unk> to <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having a <unk>
<unk> What's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite worker program Will and Grace program.
And you know who you have to be <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes of desperately showing his support, to make me know that I was on the side of my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts for <unk>
And I had a chance at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be real with someone, you have to be prepared for the real <unk>
It's like the hard conversations that hard conversations are not my strong point.
Ask anybody with the one I <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what involves coming out of any point is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know.
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and most important --  Let the complex.
You communicate the truth.
It will never be bothered by that.
And some of you can come out of it, you know, they have been wounded by what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark -- I had to have a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the history of what the intelligence has seen as a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater question can happen.
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a <unk> <unk> <unk> like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that you are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or from the Earth or no intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, which has no concept on Earth on Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I did a few years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurate.
Finally, in the human movement, of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I asked them for several years ago: There's a mechanism behind the intelligence that we can get from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a ubiquitous strength, which acts with the order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future of action, or keep the open choices, with a force near -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, even an imminent time -- the future <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep an open.
And so having to realize this equation, is natural ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It is the level of human <unk>
We give the intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> investigations in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have trend more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is <unk> a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any of any system in which you can find inside.
<unk> <unk> could happen multiple animal tests -- play games, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without that to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to see the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate as some other animals can cooperate pulling off opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully play a <unk> game, against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we look at <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly going to be able to make the network right now.
This same capacity of network is also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to broaden the global level, its scope from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated <unk> of actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we make smart machines, there would be a rebellion <unk>
Machines are going against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion -- in reverse.
It's not that the machines are getting smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all right, that the impulse to take control of all the future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, the general intelligence can actually emerge from taking the control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search of the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of that statement to help them build artificial intelligence, that is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of the stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
And yet, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim floating intensity of the stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light coming to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the size of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
<unk> this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
And at the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of worlds that our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
19th year, the hottest year was <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused to a global scale that are rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, no <unk>
But that I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the hope of finding places in the universe where we find life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I can tell you that the closer planets like Earth, more enjoy the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the <unk> planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor on Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world to show this for a mission as the Kepler mission.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable at the past and partly that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are able to see their surface in search of the origins of life as well as we know it.
And the satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But despite all these images that remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked to our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay <unk> places -- compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and more dry and further places on the Earth, the air is cool and filled with oxygen forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets drag out with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars expect out there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like exploration, I'm in a profound disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for <unk> to humanity is like imagine that the feast of Titanic is to tell us that the party of the Titanic will have place later on the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration, and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They find more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the theoretical Enrico Fermi asked me to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of planets that will make this development.
It's arrogant to think that just colonization we will save ourselves from ourselves, but the <unk> and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put the hostile environments to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
And a few years ago, I would get my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the table table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I got my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that it's not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought in spite of the circumstances, right there.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rhythm, and the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in place, that <unk> bad things going on.
Or at least if bad things happen.
So I started thinking about that, but until one month later, my thoughts don't understand.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked to him about the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective
This is something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and you try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent the things that were going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you have a place for the things that you lose it easily.
This sounds common of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk> works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to try to track the location of the important things, where you are, where you are the fish, which is where the fish, which are in the <unk> trees where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they <unk> the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys and reading and <unk>
So at home, a place for the keys, a hook alongside the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you get a place and they're <unk> with it all the time you're going to be there when you <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card license from drive, your passport, your <unk> <unk> in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you are under stress, your brain releases your brain.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and we have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation that when you face in a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is kind of like a <unk> for a whole result of medical choices, and in fact to make the financial decisions and social decision making, any kind of decision that you need to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have a result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease -- heart disease.
So you're thinking that the high cholesterol is not the best, so the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce your <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world -- even it's likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, an statistic that you have to ask for which most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
So what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or stand for surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not from the doctor, and if it comes to somebody, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needed to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they can help someone else to help someone else to help someone else.
300.
This is the research of the cynical researchers -- <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently of <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 to lower my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the prescription of all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Okay?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain <unk> but they're thinking, "Well, five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress they don't think clearly.
So think about how to make this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken us five percent of the 300 people have side effects that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out with the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the value, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have luck, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this whole thing on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice so many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but unless you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a <unk> is not necessary with the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, not really properly -- you could get the lunch lunch in the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the ultimate logical thought as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail at the time.
The idea is to think about the future as those <unk> to put the systems in the place that helps to minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination with the door, with a key on the front door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical signal.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree -- there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can I ever come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the <unk> American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came over the decade in 1800, and over time, it mixed with local signs and developed the language that we now know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, and they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following blindly their rules, providing behaviors and norms and <unk>
So how do I understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure the covered in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, the sound is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
It will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds across the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent of sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing the guy with my thumb -- it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more of art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and get it out.
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> a social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art job, or I could tell you <unk>
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like not to have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like equal and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value, as they take a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue this practice, I feel that I could get it into the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic environment, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can not capture and express completely on the paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> what it means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signs as the sound of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is split into a lot of different <unk>
If it's <unk> a different parameter for every finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as the piano, the English piano, is a linear language, like <unk> just a <unk> at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the place to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the pattern, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- they can be able to express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal.
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and <unk> it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of the <unk> the sun goes out and he's wearing.
This is all day."
If you get it out, and you look at the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what the time expresses time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> it again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk>
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head, like your chest, like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language signs across the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest of it, but they are looking very different.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> live and wealthier as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have a sound -- automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove of trove and I would like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can be in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
It involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence, or a ignorance bubble I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also need to be <unk> and they are not very good to clean up the other.
The time in the country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizen and invention at the Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach with lots of trash <unk>
So as good citizens, we would have to do the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these large ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study it under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it is also very risky to use those enormous papers.
So along with my students, with ages from six to 15 years, we dream about invent a better way.
We have transformed our little classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> labor <unk> so that the children are very excited -- can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools are very cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
We do that.
I leave it with the imagination of my students.
My job is trying to take the best ideas of every child and try and get it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic just <unk>
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would be <unk> with the robots.
Then we create what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned light off and the web cameras on it, and they put it into a floating robot that will move away by the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating around, slowly through the sensor while the computer on board is processing this image and measuring the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else gets it even more.
The cool thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix this.
I am able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very early kids.
You see the news, you see the Internet, the Internet, and you're going to stand with this picture.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what there is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> what can help to identify what there is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or about a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I could go to a more difficult problem and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, according to the reports of a 300 tons still are filtering from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution from <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, and most of the time, has a safe thing is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the land, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we put in the center of <unk> here is the use of masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> their entire life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And so we could see that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the summit of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition -- the closest close to the date.
We zoom in up to 1.5 miles of nuclear station, and with the fishermen of fishermen in the area were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking device that we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've just been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, can basically be built almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> asking things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or we can help in the advanced population mobility transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy that we can leave our kids are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrific truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, creators, we must prepare to the next generation for the environment and the people, and so I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures in the <unk>
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces -- the other one silk designer.
One of them is synthetic another organic one.
One is a <unk> on the environment, the other thing he believed.
One is designed by nature, the other one by it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the raw, he saw a figure that fights for being free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information that required it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world in place, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects as <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk> in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin with the pores of <unk>
The skins of the back is <unk> with little <unk>
You act mostly like a <unk> the other mainly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen, which represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every single designer and an architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis is shown in the two screens after me.
My job at the most simple level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and moving into growth.
You probably wonder why now?
Why was it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through scale, and large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 meters in diameter with a base of the <unk> and print buildings -- <unk> <unk> and graphs at the nanoscale <unk> made that shine into the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every single aperture is only to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> that was for a <unk> of Paris <unk> with <unk> they're going <unk> It's like a second <unk> made from one piece, <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> with no seams between the cells.
This helmet combines stiff materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this <unk> analytical analytical and the <unk> instruments to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural <unk> and it also absorbs the sound too.
The Carter <unk> my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
They put this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> and color, and color, <unk> to the energy points in the human body.
His surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home -- but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and found a lot of what it matters to me.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, and it would have either leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> cortex, <unk>
The Earth created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if the objects were made of a used <unk>
Tell a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the kind of <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year for organisms like shrimp, quote, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could <unk> their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal. <unk>  We asked a lot of seed husks the <unk> and produced toothpaste <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and create these structures made from a single three billion feet long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves it dry to find a natural form in contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a <unk> of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that first night on the planet three billion years ago, we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make the transition with no problems of infrared telescopes, and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best number for objects that are designed for <unk> put in the sea, and they put the life on the sea, they will help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- new biological issues within very small channels.
This is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these dense crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you get rid of two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second -- E. <unk> the bacteria <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light on sugar, the other consumed sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never was <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help us to make these bacteria and make their way into their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the functionality of functionality as well.
If we wanted more <unk> but more transparent channels.
This visual system is going to be able to go from one end to the other, it goes down to 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> <unk> <unk>
What if design would have the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase will happen.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, we have the natural tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This caterpillar from <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in a home inside which they were <unk>
The manufacture is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two protein in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers together.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first is turned into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of the best understanding how this complex process, we attach a little magnet to the head of an silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, by putting the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different places, and we've discovered that the shape -- the <unk> the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we can design these templates we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot and making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms are moving into the darkest and <unk> and so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and the heat, where the silk worms are on the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
We asked a <unk> of silk to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to deal with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom bottom of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
The <unk> biological silk about the silk -- <unk> -- they give all this pavilion out of our integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other <unk> empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which leads us to turn, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of the creation, which brings us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature of the design that requires us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they asked when they asked them for the first time.
They can <unk> with the fingers.
Three. Three. Three. Three.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest but I had <unk>
At the school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and he went on and I was playing the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something completely different, and I'm going to get it out of it, and I'm going to let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it out.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose a thing, to deny all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was concerned that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me by not <unk> at all.
I was concerned with fear of commitment, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to ask myself for me then.
They want themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
Let me tell you where they have learned about culture.
Do you first ask you what you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that no one matters what they were at that age.
It's considered a matter of <unk> to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This asks us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asking you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you remove the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by kids to dream of what they might be, not inspired by dreaming of everything that they might be.
In fact, it does that, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults are probably <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different themes that wake up with curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> for the say.
I could help if you divide up in three parts: a potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can do the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance the ideal was the ideal that I was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It would be any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or <unk> that you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in the way that way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualizing mathematics and design, when they found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at the intersections.
And from there the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can get a lot of these <unk> points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is <unk>
When we get them, we are interested in something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> so many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> in a full time and independent author of it.
As a pianist pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known one.
Before it become a writer, he was a <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps to write a compelling launches for editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to have a loss of time to do what you want to even if at the end of the end.
You can apply that knowledge into a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. It is to say, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the CEO of videos, and sometimes a professional pages designer -- sometimes teacher, sometimes teacher, sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take a lot of <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> for three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> themselves.
We have complex problems, but now we need creative creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, on your heart <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas in ideas, and the <unk> offers a range of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and careers that are going to do with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them will be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there is one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart attack, then <unk> for all media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just have to realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes, I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
They looked at the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important -- <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman called <unk> they took it to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but I would take away from it until unfortunately passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plates, and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising thing.
If you had been alive today, we could not give it to her more help than the fact that he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
You've found antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for the <unk> and so much more.
But it has been progress in treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But in 2050, it's going to affect 150 million that, by the way, including a lot of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend their years with Alzheimer's disease or helping take care of a friend or want to be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Already in the U.S., Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of the five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
This is the most expensive disease and its costs, a <unk> increase in five times in 2050, as long as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one you can't afford to cure or even slow down.
We understand less Alzheimer's than other diseases because we spend less time and money on the research.
The United States government spends 10 times more every year in cancer cancer in the fact that the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a single annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everyone Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For the most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, get Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We thought to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But there is only to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the heart of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain is caused by Alzheimer's significantly reducing life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today, we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think a molecule of protein like a piece of paper that it folds up like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> points end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of them are <unk> in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other -- forming groups that can form great plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identifying what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that you would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> hardware, the hardware, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to figure out a critical step in the process, and now you're testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened to the test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick each other inside them, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stages, then we see that we are going to be <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial <unk> but the research as this shows Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We must be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry drug pharmaceutical companies.
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and helping to demand a cure.
Thank you.
We put this article in the column of the New York Times column, in January of this year.
In love with somebody to do this.
The paper is about a psychological study -- designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience when we try it -- just one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions, and then they both look in the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
It's <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to get your partner what do you like to or her, I know very honest this time, and I put things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came up with this study a few years ago, a really detail that struck me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but then it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect them to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column -- I just send it to the spinal column just a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking yourselves all the way together.
And the reason I think you know this is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I was thrilled to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entry can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends, and I thought that my article in the New York Times could probably have a few thousand <unk>
And that's a good attention burden in a relatively new relationship.
But as it happened, I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday on a Friday night, and the Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And <unk> had already called the Today, Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper was more than eight million views, and I was, by saying something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage you to encourage you to make trust writing with <unk> but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or had a few of what they did every day for weeks, always, first the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email to my email with the phrase: <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately threw myself red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for Saint <unk> that included the experiences of the readers to prove the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that they both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders for us two.
I think it was afraid to become the iconic icons of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it was really <unk> or it is, if it was able to produce love -- not only an adventure, but real love -- love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead I was looking for foster interpersonal students in college students, using what he was called called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds silly, right?
But the study did work.
The participants got closer after doing that, several later studies, they also used the <unk> <unk> <unk> like a rapid form of creating trust and interaction among strangers.
They've used it among members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of the <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately, it never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little <unk> college university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He looked like <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want you to tell you about the person who you love this?
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> I did get better known after the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had this relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to practically all my adult life, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I turned to science.
I did all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just research for the book that I write -- but in retrospect, it seems to be really <unk>
I thought if I was excited about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I sat back then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably they can demand me.
What I'm looking for is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that means about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love that makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that I ask that question: still follow together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's think about asking questions more difficult questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love, and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are going to be done, and how do you know when to cut and get it.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more inclusive conversation about what means to love somebody.
So if you want the brief version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still followed together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it is not true, but because at the time, I wasn't really thought about what that choice was.
It didn't seem how many times we have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, I have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind and fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe really.
And what I'm going to do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also also love, and it's scary -- but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian in full mountain, and in a way, I got a <unk> in the forest.
And the city of New York does a time.  So something that really affected me but more details later on.
I start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, for a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and figure it out, how do we eat ideas, ideas, for example, how do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> like going out of training and <unk> and all of these <unk> things, and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> in the style Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added a lot more on the canvas, thinking that I could be <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed that it grew up size, as if it was that it was going to take the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
So this time, I started to add together with it, we started to add into the street, all I could find out on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things because I was looking for things that I tried to try and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow from <unk> drawing the same as you do about a dead <unk>
And I took the objects, and I created my own taxonomy of specimens at all.
First of all, let's notice that you might be able to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the layers of glass, similar to the drawing on a window, and then another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that create a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a lot of the <unk> garden <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 3,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double my face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with the heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They're going to be the world of representation, on this <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is where creatures with animals in animals run into the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god a bird strapped to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> diameter <unk> a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened that.
Things that go around you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> <unk> made of 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very good at his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts like a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they get away.
And you can walk between them. I'm taking a few years.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get it <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are a few pills that come out and come into the head of this weird statue of it.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician a musician -- a writer, a <unk> a museum, a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world -- and a garden.
It will take the box and all the people in inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the <unk> of religion, does not work.
We're all very made out of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against the pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug <unk> effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these serve the amount of virus in the blood, and you will increase the cells that are <unk>
But they are also known for their side effects by <unk> because in the time that it takes in the time to get to the <unk> they will be <unk> and worse for the time it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV shop.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> the <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't be easily in the bloodstream, of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the drugs that are going to be a life treatment of life that are running by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, make the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the quality of wounds and surgery, you can use it for anything else -- including the drug transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're using corn pulses to open or drill out extremely small holes and open up extremely small holes and close the cells with HIV to bring the medicines into the drug.
The best people are asked, "How is that <unk>
We sent a very powerful laser ray about the <unk> cell membrane on the HIV cell -- while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drug drug.
The laser through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or at <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> at the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all investigator of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've been studying armed armed groups, armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent involvement to violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
I used to be a <unk> among states.
anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed between a state and an actor who signed up with each other.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any resolution process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they think about it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies are not armed with <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s <unk> it's also established a political game, a network of social services and a military system.
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking them.
They put a complex machine, of communication stations, radio stations and TV channels and TV websites and strategies in social media.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business -- for example, building construction companies.
These are the key activities.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit to make their brand.
The armed groups are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put hospitals, they put their professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population, offering something that the state didn't make security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan destroyed by the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price unbearably peak for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a vacuum -- a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows them to build and increase their power.
For example, victory <unk> in 2006 -- Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, involved in violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these are organizations, we can do it as a way to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all their functions, collect the trash system, run the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, in nations and hybrids and so much more weak are the states, like the Middle East -- the <unk> the <unk> and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups that are going to be investing more in military tools.
<unk> that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we'll understand better how incentives offer to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors -- the military power can make some battles, but not give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security gap to fill that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews -- people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women were <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> sex as if that was bad stuff.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the <unk> that could be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word and nasty.
I was <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that <unk> woman until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They put the same wages for the same job.
We have right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use <unk> and accessible to contraceptives and services ...
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to see our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and <unk> and skills and so much more.
We need to have to realize these differences and how we get ourselves in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the job, listen to rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and offends me, the classic <unk> classic from yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely excited about my musical law.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> maintenance and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It would be made out of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales, which make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not a person for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I don't have that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> Feminism -- conventional Feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the workers, gay workers, and <unk> for white women, <unk> in middle class.
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist issue.
It also happens to the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend in <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we want to make it really hard.
When we get into the <unk> with a lot of love from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think about that <unk> before I try to put it up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative people and the leaders of the sector, have a fear of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear of what that label means by fear of not being able to be able to fulfill the little bit of realistic.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
Over the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music Music Music <unk> in <unk> in front of the word <unk> from three meters high.
It was a <unk> show to see this star star and embrace openly the Feminism and the young men who have to be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> time, the cultural critics started arguments, if it was <unk> it was or not exactly a feminist.
It will make their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
They are still struggling with the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot.
We go far beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to get rid of the Feminism of any woman, <unk> until it was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question or more good, a <unk> Feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to <unk> to the action and being a little bit more brave.
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad decisions make it make it harder for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two girls who are <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
It will be given by the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be known as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than as dumb objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, the men, especially young men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to be going to post in your magazine, or to work with you, until you don't bring a number of enough number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but we will be able to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to be even even more like us to even more like us, to overcome the barriers to the decision boxes.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our choices will come to the top, to people in the power of asking and producers and music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim with courage our feminism, but bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I mean it above all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated like it was nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't tell me I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I got myself into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant living in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if it was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have the <unk> reality.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to make my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit of courageous, when you need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with an immune system -- is one of the most likely diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccine <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines are causing autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger of their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rising estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creates their entire professional life without seeing a single case.
Over decades, the estimates of prevalence continued stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
And the fundraising skills of funds like <unk> <unk> is routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could get rid of another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control Center and what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic -- and a <unk> <unk> to explain these figures out.
But that kind of language don't <unk> the fear of a young mother who seeks to the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be made, why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the proud of storytelling.
Over the most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having an devastating impact on the global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a psychiatrist psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns York City <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds going to people around them, even their own parents.
They could be fun for hours waving their hands before their faces, but they were kind of <unk> of the <unk> because they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients were treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their <unk> while <unk> references of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism was very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had been <unk> that he had turned nine out of 10 children to their office in their office in being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of children's <unk> caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've kept very carefully in a refrigerator that didn't happen.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were simply taking their parents -- what they heard their parents are desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it was not until the 1970s, that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm, warm people and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as they had no service support, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for the people for autistic children and families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse reality.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with the astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
On the other way, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as they said <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one didn't realize these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article -- and then he <unk> buried under the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for the teaching of children with learning differences were <unk> even in contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with action exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parent of causing Asperger's as a <unk> disability of life that had <unk> <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces during the course of all of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's -- their little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were particularly right for them.
And we've seen autism as a diverse continuum that causes a surprising variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were ordinary and always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in the <unk> known of pop culture like the awkward social scientist and the teacher <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to broaden the criteria of diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes came into the <unk> to the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fell in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what was the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents all over the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, the first similar clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little set of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in criteria and introduction of these evidence created a <unk> network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that the people with autism and their families eventually will support the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. A simple, powerful, and <unk> <unk> history as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is the right -- the <unk> are one of the world's greatest groups.
Over the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from the details.
No doubt people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which creates that the <unk> for the most intriguing aspects of autism are in the understanding of the teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on the cover of the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford a waste or a brain.
Thank you.
